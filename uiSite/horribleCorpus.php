			<div>Elizabeth's Story</div><div></div><div></div><div>Introduction</div><div></div><div>It's in the night I feel alive</div><div>I know the dark: it's warm inside</div><div>like the heat you try to hide</div><div>And the people in light who know you lie.</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, Just Tonight</div><div></div><div>Summer died like an old, bitter man. Clinging as long as it could for just one breath more, scrabbling to pull in another choking, sputtering lungful of air. Elizabeth Belenos, or Bel, as she was known on the streets of her adopted town, watched her third summer in Maplebrook come to an end with grim satisfaction. It wasn't a large city, though it had its share of all-night takeaways and twenty four hour diners that seem to be the staple of large cities everywhere. It had art galleries, and arcades, and promenades. There were parks, little artificial boroughs where there greensward was allowed its own little dominion.</div><div>There existed in the town scholarship, and two distinct colleges sporting prestigious libraries. And there was a large and active police force, though this did not rate highly on Bel's list of things that mattered. One way or another, the police had never been much of an entity to Bel. Either they left her alone, in which case she did not care about them, or they interfered, and she did not hesitate to respond with anything less than overwhelming force. She had read somewhere that the most dangerous thing in the world is a policeman only injured. With this in mind, she was careful about where the bodies were hidden.</div><div>The city had trade on the water, and the docks were always bustling with activity and the river was disgusting for miles down the stream because of the citizens who regarded it as a convenient way of cleaning up their trash. The docks were a wonderful place to practice thievery and almost any kind of smuggling. The city wasn't quite big enough to qualify for the really good kind of security, which make it a very nice place to sneak things aboard.</div><div>There were occult libraries in this city, hidden truths and dark lies that were mixed with such facility that it was almost impossible to tell one from the other, and sometimes it didn't matter which was which. Bel did not believe in the occult, as it was traditionally viewed.</div><div>Bel believed in power. And she believed in fear.</div><div>And in the libraries that existed in Maplebrook, either in the city itself or those below the earth, Bel had found what she was looking for. Three long years had passed her by, and she had woken up screaming for many of those nights, but she had found the object of her search. Power over fear, and her nightmares. Power over others. The power, she fancied, of protection. And so she set out to use it.</div><div>And she did.</div><div></div><div>Never Stay Lost</div><div></div><div>The autumn leaves are falling on my head,</div><div>And the smell of leaf mold is in my hair,</div><div>The wind is come down from the mountains,</div><div>And there’s some strong fire in the air.</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, End All</div><div></div><div>It was about six o’clock when Kimberly crossed over into Sokonis Park.  The deciduous trees offered their bare limbs to the sky, and their shed leaves drifted on the ground. The sun wavered through light clouds, a hand’s breadth above the mountains. Orange light shading into scarlet lanced through the evergreens and colored the woods with a dusky brush. Her skin orange in the fading light, Kimberly kept one eye peeled for the wolf pine that grew near a turning of the trail. It was a rookery, and she hadn’t seen a truly large one since she had moved to the city for college.</div><div>Kimberly wandered on at a meandering pace. She wished she had someone to meet. Something to be late for. Engagements were what birthdays were for. She checked her watch: six-fifteen. If she had been going to see someone, she could be late by now. Instead, Kimberly caught herself staring at the ancient and craggy wolf pine. Its trunk was brown-gray, shading to black and dark green at the newer growth.</div><div>Two crows cocked their heads at her. Perched idly on the lower branches of the pine, they cawed twice as she approached. Sometimes, when she was young, crows and magpies had brought her gifts. She had never said anything about them. A chill crawled along Kimberly’s back, and she found herself hunching her shoulders against a rising, electric tension in the air.</div><div>“Hi. Have you seen my friends?” She asked, to break the silence. “They’ve got black feathers, are about so long,” she measured out a foot with her hands.</div><div>“And there are usually thee of them. Haven’t seen them for a couple of months, though.”</div><div>The orange light painted everything with a rosy palette. The crows ducked and called while Kimberly spoke in Shakespearean asides. And who are you, my friend? What is your name? Do you know the birds from my home?</div><div>They bobbed their heads, shouted raw calls to the sky.  Shortly another pair of crows, breaking the tense atmosphere with raucous calls and fluttering wings, joined them. They settled on the same limb as the first birds, tails flared for drag, feet extended to catch the branch. Shortly behind them was another blackbird, nearly twice the size of the crows. When his tail flared in landing, Kimberly saw the wedge-shaped gap in its tail feathers</div><div>“Well, who are you, my friend? Not a rook, or your brothers would be here, too. Could you be—“</div><div>“Corvus Corax, the common raven.” Kimberly spun, to find a man standing perhaps five feet from her. Two long paces back, on the edge of the trail, he had a bird perched on his shoulder. “Cousin to your friends, Corvus Brachyrhynchos. But then, you knew that.”</div><div>He bowed. “Willow Gray, at your service. I see you’ve found the Dwelling.”</div><div>“Umm. What?”</div><div>“The Dwelling. You know, from Jane Candle, Dwelling in the Dell? Where the beautiful dryad lives inside her tree, protected by crows?”</div><div>“No,” Kimberly edged away from Willow, closer to the tree.</div><div> “Oh, well, I suppose not many people have a use for obscure late-nineteenth century poets.”</div><div>“Where did you come from? You weren’t behind me.”</div><div>“I don’t have much use for trails. They take you where they go, without paying attention to where you need to go,” Willow stepped into the path, closer to the tree. “Sometimes I cross them, though. And walk them for a space.“</div><div>“That’s nice. What are you doing out here?”</div><div>“Walking. It’s a nice day, and I didn’t have anyone to meet. No place to be, so I thought that maybe paying a visit to the Dwelling would be in order. Did you know that this is the second biggest rookery in the city?”</div><div>Kimberly shook her head, hands in her pockets. “No. So, you don’t have anywhere to be?”</div><div>“No. I seldom do. My social engagements are few and far between,” Willow raised one eyebrow. “Am I keeping you from something you intended to do?”</div><div>“Not really. I wasn’t up to much. Talking with my friends,” she laughed, gestured to the black birds. “I’ve been speaking with them since I was a little girl.”</div><div>“With? You mean to, surely? It has been some time since I met someone who had the speech of the birds.”</div><div>“The speech of the birds? You mean Mayan? No, I don’t speak Mayan either.”</div><div>“How novel. No, my reference was to our feathered saurian companions of course. I needs must rely on a pair of interpreters.” Willow gestured to the raven on his shoulder. “This is Huginn,” he waved his hand at the tree, “and there, mingling with his cousins, is Muninn.”</div><div>Kimberly reached out to Huginn hesitantly, “they’re…tame?”</div><div>The large bird waited until her hand was almost at his head. Then he jumped, beating his wings one, twice, and extending his claws for landing. They dug deeply into Kimberly’s flannel shirt while Huginn waved his wings for balance.</div><div>“Gaahh! Friggin’ bird!” She spun in a circle, while Willow’s raven settled in for the duration.</div><div>Willow regarded this turn of events with a certain amount of detachment. With a smile, he straightened the lapels of his jacket, snapping his wrists straight.</div><div>“If you leave him be, he’ll settle down fairly quickly.” Willow turned, started to walk around the path, then paused. “Are you coming? I feel like coffee.”</div><div>In the Bohemian Coffee House which Willow called the “Bo,” Kimberly sipped some fairly tolerable coffee. In the heavily upholstered chair across from her, Willow drank his tea. Huginn and Muninn had bestirred themselves to cross the table, and now perched on its further end, dipping their bills in a glass of water.</div><div>“So, what do you think?</div><div>“Not bad coffee. It’s kind of dark in here. Tell me, why the “Bo”?”</div><div>“Ah,” Willow leaned back, sipping at his tea. “The food is quite inexpensive here, the establishment is warm, and the proprietor doesn’t mind if his patrons occasionally fall asleep for a few hours.”</div><div>He set the cup down, gestured at the comfortable, low furniture. It was alternately filled with shadows and scruffy young people. Lots of layers were in evidence, some stylish, some decidedly not. The low lighting made it easy to fall asleep, gleaming from pokerwork sconces and low-wattage bulbs. The paint on the walls was a dark red, deeper than blood and glorious in the quickly fading evening light.</div><div>“Kimberly, this is a safe place for the street folk. Thus, the Bohemian Coffee House. The Bo.” He stirred his tea with a finger, which he withdrew presently with a single amber droplet clinging to it. Willow shook his hand, and it was gone.</div><div>Kimberly blinked, nodding, “so you have a place to sleep, eat, and you’re fairly secure. Makes sense.”</div><div>“Indeed. So what have I co-opted you from? Surely you had a delightful evening planned?”</div><div>“Eugh. Not really. My boyfriend and I were supposed to do something for my birthday, but we had a fight this weekend. So no more plans for today.”</div><div>“Oh dear. I hadn’t intended to bring up unpleasant feelings. Speaking of unpleasant, how’s that coffee?”</div><div>Kimberly sipped again, then made a face, surprised at how quickly it had turned sour. “Cold and bitter.”</div><div>“That’s one downside of the otherwise effervescent Bo. One needs must make it through one’s drink while it is still hot, or one might actually begin to taste it.” Willow smiled, set his cup on the scarred Formica of the table. “I think I might prefer to find some other place to roost. Annie is having a rent party, tonight –she’s stuck in the twenties, I swear she would dress like a flapper every day if she could get away with it. If you’d care to  come along, I’m sure you’d be welcome at the party.”</div><div>“Party?” She shrank from the word.</div><div>“Party, my dear. Soiree, fete, feast, banquet, gala, ball, festivity, function, affair!” He waved his hands, “Leo is a starving artist friend of Annie’s and he’s come up short on rent, so she and a few of her friends are putting up some music and leaving the door open in the hopes that some few souls will be entertained enough to donate. I donated the drummer, so I am sure no one will mind you coming.”</div><div>“You donated the drummer,” Kimberly latched onto the phrase. “Your girlfriend?”</div><div>Willow chuckled, shook his head. “Oh, no. No girlfriend. I just know people, and one of them happened to be a drummer. Things worked out.”</div><div>“Oh. Um. Yeah, I guess I’d like to go along.” If nothing else, it was something to be late for. Kimberly paused, then.</div><div>“Will there be a lot of people there?”</div><div>Willow chuckled again, smiled at her. “I hope so.”</div><div></div><div>The stairwell was dark. Also, the individual steps creaked alarmingly when Kimberly put weight on them. The dim starlight filtering in through the skylight was all she had to see by, and she ended up clinging to Willow’s arm most of the way up. Huginn and Muninn had left them when they entered the stairwell, circling up into the darkness. Kimberly’s world extended no further than she could taste and touch and smell and hear. Willow’s coat was coarse. Green cloth, she remembered, it felt like velvet woven from linen thread. It smelled like he did, woods and wind, and warm smoke; a good smell.</div><div>When the stair gave way, Kimberly started to fall. She let go of Willow’s arm, flailing for a railing. Her own scream blotted out whatever Willow might have said, but not the fierce scream of a raven –what must have been Huginn or Muninn above her, echoing in the stairwell. Whoever it was, something strong and warm and very fast grabbed hold of her collar as her shoulders passed through the shattered tread. The beating of wings filled her ears in the dark, and under them she heard only her rushing heart and the tap-tap of feet brushing unstable wood as she reversed direction.</div><div>Her legs kicked free again, out of the stairs, and then she was set down. The strong hand at her collar moved to cup her neck, retreated, and took hold of her shoulder.</div><div>“Just a moment.” Willow’s voice, close enough that she could feel his breath on her face.</div><div>And there was light. A tea-light, sitting in its tin container, throwing a circle of warm yellow illumination over the landing. Willow removed his cupped hands from the candle. One closed hand he slid into his pocket; it returned open and empty.</div><div>“Are you unharmed? That was a rather close call.”</div><div>“Shit. Shit, that’s scary.” Kimberly wrapped her arms around her legs. “How did you catch me? I couldn’t even see you.”</div><div>“I could hear you. My ears are very sensitive and,” Willow smiled a bit, “still slightly ringing. You were very loud”</div><div>“Oh. Um, oh. Your friend lives here?”</div><div>He nodded. “Although I suspect she will be using the rear stairs for some time. Shall we go on?”</div><div>Kimberly took his extended hand and let him pull her up. She noticed Huginn and Muninn were again perched on Willow’s shoulders.</div><div>“Odd.”</div><div>“What’s that?”</div><div>“When I was falling, all I could hear was the beating of their wings. That, and raven screams.”</div><div>Willow shrugged, one arm about her shoulders. “Ravens can get distressed when someone they like is in danger.”</div><div>“They like me?”</div><div>A little line of tea-lights led through the darkened hall to an open door from which spilled light, and music, and laughter. “So it would seem, Kimberly.”</div><div>Inside, the apartment was a big loft affair. It had a small, clearly tacked-on kitchen, and a shadowy hall in the far corner, leading to the bedroom. An enormous window dominated the east wall, letting in light from the rising moon. Set before the window, a band with a half-dozen members whose faces glowed with rubicund pleasure. Perhaps two dozen people swirled around in the high-ceilinged room, faces mobile, cups in hand. For the most part, the party-babble was quiet, hanging back from the music—some kind of jazzy rock—so that everyone could hear. Track lighting threw everyone into high relief, though some of the lower bulbs were dimmed—to preserve the mood, or because they had blown, Kimberly didn’t know.</div><div>Willow touched her arm. “Kimberly, I’d like you to meet a friend of mine, Robin Redsson. Robin, this is Kimberly Aurora Ainedan.”</div><div>Robin Redsson grinned, shook her hand. He was dressed entirely in bright red. His grin was catching, and Kimberly felt herself smiling.</div><div>“Pleased to meet you, Robin.”</div><div>“Kimberly,” Willow again. “This is Annie, she’s sitting out a set. We’re in her apartment tonight.”</div><div>“This is Leo, he knows Annie through her painting, rather than her music.”</div><div>“Zoe,” she blinked owlishly. Smiled from the far side of thick glasses.</div><div>“Leslie,” who hugged her, rather then shake hands.</div><div>“Jane,” whispered in Willow’s ear, then squeezed Kimberly’s shoulder.</div><div>“Sarah,” nodded slowly, evaluating Kimberly. Her eyes didn’t miss much.</div><div>“Eddie,” who looked like a mafioso.</div><div>“Tony,” who looked like a street-rat.</div><div>The welter of introductions went on, until Kimberly had been shown and shown to everyone present. The band stopped playing, and Annie made her way to the front of the crowd.</div><div>“Um,” Kimberly touched Annie’s shoulder before she took the stage, “where’s the bathroom?”</div><div>Annie pointed for her. “Through my bedroom, it’s the door across from the way in, hon.”</div><div>Annie took the stage and her guitar back. “So what’s it gonna be? And don’t you dare say Freebird, Leo.”</div><div>That was the last Kimberly heard as the party noise turned into a murmur, tuned into auditory mush. She dodged her way through Annie’s bedroom, cluttered with canvases, knocked on the door of the bathroom. Empty. She went in, locked the door. It was very quiet in the tiled room, after the loft full of people and the music. Locking to door, Kimberly used the toilet and then sat on the floor, leaning against the closed shower stall. She drew her knees up to her chest, wrapped her arms around them. It took her quite some time to realize that the hiccuping sound coming from deep in her throat was the start of tears.</div><div>Eventually, she snuffled her way through the tears, and crawled over to the toilet paper dispenser. Instant tissues, which she used liberally. Then she wet some and wiped the salty trails from her face. Kimberly presented a pleasant facade to Annie’s mirror.</div><div>There was a knock on the door, and she jumped.</div><div>“Kimberly?” Willow’s voice. “Are you okay?”</div><div>“Yeah, fine. Why?”</div><div>Willow opened the door. “I thought you might be overwrought. I see I was wrong. Care to come out? About half the people are gone, and Annie’s broken out the Turkish coffee.”</div><div>The door had been locked.</div><div>Sometimes the crows brought her gifts. Kimberly never mentioned them. Willow smiled.</div><div>“Thank you,” she whispered.</div><div>“I'm sorry?” Willow enquired.</div><div>“Nothing,” she lied, and kissed him full on the lips.</div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>A Thing Called Love</div><div></div><div>Away you go</div><div>turning me to light</div><div>my face so long in shadow</div><div>why do I feel delight?</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Flash-floodlights</div><div></div><div>The blackbirds were what turned her. No one who was a bad person could have maintained the trust of a pair of ravens. Not her totem animal, but they were close cousins, and cousins wouldn't lie to each other. Besides, his fingers were soft when he brushed them against her face, and they were firm when he kept her from slipping in the drifts of dead leaves on their way home to his house. He had a nice voice, and when he suggested that maybe he show Kimberly home and take her around to his house some other time, when she wasn't so sleepy, it just decided her.</div><div>She wasn't going home tonight.</div><div>It was windy, like all fall nights were windy, and the light from the streetlights did little if anything to help with visibility. If not for Willow,she would have been sitting on her butt more than a few times on the way home. And that wasn't counting all the times when she faked falling so he'd catch her. So far, he hadn't missed a single catch, but the way he was acting, he wasn't going to catch on, and that wouldn't do at all.</div><div>The Turkish coffee left her with buzzing, twitching high that she couldn't fight, and whenever she touched him it felt as if she were some charged-up battery as sparks of nervous energy danced across her fingertips.</div><div>“I think I love you,” she giggled.</div><div>“And I think you really should go home. That spiked coffee isn't doing you any favors, and I don't think you're going to thank me for it in the morning.”</div><div>“No, s'perfect. Just what I needed to loosed up, chill out. Lucky Annie had the whiskey close by.”</div><div>They slowed to a stop outside a small church or cathedral. Kimberly wasn't sure what the difference was. The lawn was large, and lined with a mixed selection of trees. Around the outskirts of the long part of the church, all about the foundations were terraced flower beds edged in stone. They were mostly bordered with bales of hay, and some of the garden beds themselves were covered with loose straw. Someone had been preparing it for winter. Kimberly though that it might be the sort of church she wouldn't mind going to. If nothing else, they probably weren't the kind of Baptists who couldn't read any parts of the bible that didn't contain the words 'hellfire' and 'eternal damnation'. That kind of yard spoke of someone who could have fun, and the preacher from Mama's church always had trouble with fun.</div><div>There was even a little stone-tiled path that wound, in a round-about way, to what Kimberly suspected was a side or back entrance. The door wasn't big enough to admit more than one person at a time, but there was a little lamp flickering above it. Someone was home, offering sanctuary to travelers. Or something like that. Kimberly's Church lore was rusty, but she thought the light above the door was supposed to mean 'sanctuary'.</div><div>“I rather suspect that turning drinks 'Irish' isn't an AMA -approved practice for assisting in socialization.”</div><div>“Well, fuck th' AMA. Hippocratical bastards.”</div><div>“Hypocritical, maybe?”</div><div>“Huh? Never mind, it'll look better written down. And I didn't have that much of it anyway. Two ounces tops, and it takes more than that to get me drunk. Slurring 'cause 'm tired.”</div><div>“I think that does more to illustrate my point, you should be going home to a warm bed.”</div><div>Kimberly shrugged, taking in the whole night and the two AM winds and the bright stars and the stiff chilliness that whipped down the streets to flail at Willow's coat in one elegant gesture. “This is better. How much further?”</div><div>“Actually, it's just here,” Willow gestured at the building Kimberly had mistaken for a church.</div><div>“No way.”</div><div>“Yes way.”</div><div>“It looks an awful lot like a religious building: was it a church in a past life?”</div><div>Willow laughed and started up the path, “this house was built to my specifications and has had no other owner.”</div><div>Kimberly wrinkled her brow. “But you said that you were new in town.”</div><div>“I have some extraordinary resources at my disposal,” Willow said, chuckling. “Of course, now that I've said that you'll think I'm rich and try to rob me.”</div><div>The wind blew hard, and Willow’s coat billowed out, flapping near-horizontally in the gale. It scooped and snapped wildly, scalloped against the air like a pair of wings. The green fabric rustled and crinkled.  It flapped, curled against the wind as if possessed of its own muscles. Then the wind died, and it returned to being just a coat. Willow smiled.</div><div>“Let's go inside. I'm getting cold,” Kimberly lied.</div><div>So they did, wending their way up the stone pathway, past a small jungle of plants and a verdant lawn that looked as if it needed to be cut, even by the moonlight. Kimberly watched the light come closer, and leaned more on Willow as they closed on it. He was half propping her up when they got to his door. The light above the door was an oil lamp, which Willow blew out once he had the door open. She slipped her arms inside his coat in that space when he should have been fumbling his keys back out of the door, and had to stumble-step to stay with him. Which suited Kimberly just fine, as Willow caught her before she hit the ground. Huginn and Muninn leapt away from Willow's shoulders as soon as he had passed the threshold, and abandoned him for the backs of some worn leather chairs.</div><div>Willow set her back on her feet and slipped from her grasp. Taking her coat in one hand and his own in the other, he threw his shoulder against the door to close it. The thick wood was apparently solid, because Willow's not inconsiderate frame only moved it slowly. Kimberly took hold of the latch and helped him swing it closed. The coat hooks that depended from the back of the door were wrought iron, and had been secured with, as far as Kimberly was able to determine, handmade nails. Slapping her palm against the closed door, she  managed to make a slapping noise and hurt her palm.</div><div>“Ow. Good door, but I don't think it likes me. Why'd you choose mahogany for an exterior door, anyway: isn't it amazingly expensive?”</div><div>Willow paused. “How did you know that the door was mahogany?”</div><div>“You must have mentioned it on our way in.” Kimberly shrugged. Then realized that, as it was almost pitch black with that thick mahogany door closed behind them, Willow wouldn't be able to see it. Beyond a dim sense of movement from the direction of the ravens, she seemed alone.</div><div>“Willow, I can't see. Where are you?”</div><div>“Here,” he said, from perhaps two feet away from her. She shrieked, jumped, and hit him.</div><div>“Don't do that. You scared me.”</div><div>“You know, I don't know how, but I got that impression.”</div><div>“Smartass. So...what do we do now?”</div><div>Willow shrugged, and shrugged again to remove his jacket, which he hung beside Kimberly's. “I honestly don't know. You're the one who was dead-set on seeing my house.”</div><div>“Ahh, yes. There was that,” Kimberly floundered for a few moments. “Well, why don't you give me the grand tour?”</div><div>“I would, but I am afraid the house is best seen in daylight. There's also the fact that I don't actually have any electricity. At all.”</div><div>“None?”</div><div>“Not even solar.”</div><div>“Wait, didn't you say you had a fridge?”</div><div>“Gas-powered. The stove, too.”</div><div>“Okay. Well, how about you show me to a seat somewhere, and then go open a bottle of wine?”</div><div>“Weren't we talking about how you shouldn't have drunk so much just five minutes ago?”</div><div>“No, you were talking, I was looking at your pretty face.”</div><div>Willow froze. He colored slightly. Then, carefully, he said, “I'll just go get that bottle. And some glasses.”</div><div>The sense of Willow's presence moved away from her and Kimberly spoke up again.</div><div>“Could you bring some candles, too? I can't see anything here.”</div><div>“I believe I could accommodate you.”</div><div>“But not too many. I like it kind of dim.”</div><div>Willow chuckled. “Yes ma'am.”</div><div>It didn't take him long to return, and he was announced be a lessening in the general gloom of the room. In one hand, Willow carried a pair of lit candles. In the other, a large bottle of red wine and a pair of glasses occupied most of his attention. Kimberly relieved him of the candles and, holding one in either hand, lifted them high to shed their light on Willow's living room.</div><div>It was, Kimberly though, a singular reflection of its owner.</div><div>A large room with a vaulted ceiling, what Willow had called a living room looked more like some kind of cathedral. Ribbed stone columns sprung from the walls at a height of four feet, rising in unadorned lines to a barrel vault that was perhaps eighteen feet at its highest point. Honey-gold wood paneled the lower four feet of the wall, keeping the stone from being overbearing. Rather than flagstones, there was a broad hardwood floor from wall to wall with small, oval rugs set before the numerous chairs. There also were several islands of furniture. One clustered around a large hearth at the south end of the room, one was near a curtained entrance on the west side, from which Willow had entered.</div><div>Kimberly stood like that –candles raised, eyes wide, mouth moving slowly—until hot wax dripped on her wrist. “</div><div>Ow! Damn!” Suddenly she seemed to remember herself. “Sorry. Can we sit over by the fireplace?”</div><div>“Of course. Shall I pour?”</div><div>And when Kimberly nodded, he set both glasses down on a low table and commenced pouring, using his other hand to guide his house-guest around the edges of the furniture.</div><div>“Here, Kimberly. Just stick the candles in the pot with the briar-rose. They won't do it any permanent harm.”</div><div>She did so, wedging the six-inch white wax pillars into either side of the large pot. In one hand she lifted her filled glass and sipped from it. Striding to the fireplace she turned to face her host. Her heels rested upon the hearth, and the firmness of the stone reassured her as she stared at Willow. In the candles' light, his face was an ivory mask, expressionless and glowing as if lit from behind. The flickering of the light built shadows that shifted gently, as if something were between the mask and the light. Tiny darknesses, in a broad field of light. In his eyes flames spun and gyrated across the surface of his eyes, making them a pool of darkness speckled with light against the darkened light of his face.</div><div>“Come sit with me,” said Willow as he sank into the grasp of one of the overstuffed leather chairs. He chose the right and as he spoke, gestured to his left, on the far side of the briar rose. Kimberly smiled then, the smile Willow was so fond of using. And she crossed to his side and sprawled across his lap.</div><div>“Is this close enough?” She asked, and Willow could see the candlelight in her eyes the same way she saw his. One of his hands was occupied supporting Kimberly's back, but with the other he rolled the stem of glass between thumb and forefinger. She noticed, and looked quickly from Willow's hand to his face.</div><div>“Yes, yes. I imagine that it will be almost impossible for us to misunderstand each other as such close range. Don't you agree?”</div><div>Kimberly stared at him for a moment, then set down her glass. His eyes were still dark, and she felt that if she stared long enough the darkness of them might pour out like out, and fill her entirely. And she leaned forward, holding his eyes. And she kissed him.</div><div>It was a good kiss, full of fire and lightning. And if it set him to shaking inside like it had her, Kimberly knew that he would be hers, utterly and without reservation. Inasmuch as she could decide anything while she pressed herself to him, she knew that he had her for the taking. And if he didn't take her, she had certain ideas about taking him.</div><div>“Did you understand that?” Kimberly asked, slightly breathless.</div><div>And Willow nodded. “I believe I got the general idea.” He set his glass beside hers on the table. “But I think I might have missed some of the nuances of the thought. If you could say that again, I believe that I would be able to more fully explore the concept.”</div><div>She giggled, then grinned as the mask of his face split into a smile that was less than his usual enigmatic facade.</div><div>“You and your damnable smile,” she said, sinking her fingers into his hair. “Come here.”</div><div>And he did, and they drew each other upright. And Willow, taking hold of a candle while extinguishing the other, led the way upstairs. Kimberly followed, and when the door of the bedroom shut, she locked it behind them. And she smiled.</div><div></div><div>Something Fierce</div><div></div><div>trying to hold my own</div><div>against the changing city</div><div>like the Irish fighting back the tide</div><div>is a sign of madness</div><div>augur to my death.</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, Life Goes On</div><div></div><div>Bel brushed her hair back from her face, tucked the long platinum-blonde lock behind her ears. The knife-edged furrow between her brows eased when she snapped shut the lock on her door. Her room was dim, and plain. The overhead light was a weak forty watt incandescent, and it left shadows standing tall all around her. Two windows bracketed the room, their panes painted with a farded-on coat of black acrylic. Drapes that had come with the apartment four years ago, and ragged then, looked like disheveled eggshell-colored men-at-arms. The north wall held her bed, the south a desk, vanity, and chair.</div><div>Clutter was a fungus, spreading along the top of the desk and blossoming out of the open drawers of the vanity. Things that could have been ritual magic spell components –or if one were possessed of an eye for the macabre, cosmetics—competed for space across the top of the vanity with slips of paper and printouts from the internet and fragments of quotations. Byron, Shelley, and Keats on the one corner, and Hannibal Lecter on the other.</div><div>“Be grateful for your scars, Will...our scars have the power to remind us that the past was real.”</div><div>And for a second, seeing that quotation in bold, in italics on the printer paper adorning her vanity, Bel's mind moves from the other feature of the room –the ten-foot summoning circle—to her own reminders of the past, to her own scars. She touches her chest, her stomach, her thighs. It is a curiously turned-in gesture, as if she were trying to avoid being obvious, trying to play to the crowd in her empty room. Look at me, her body language said, I'm so strong that pain doesn't even slow me down.</div><div>Shrugging out of her coat, Bel held it in her left hand for a long moment before she laid it over the back of the chair. It felt heavier than it should have, and in that moment she weighed it carefully. There was nothing more in it than there had been the day before, or the day before that. But then, she hadn't known what the ritual had entailed before. Not completely. Perhaps it was the weight of her conscience drawing down on her. Not that she could afford to have such a weight at this late a date.</div><div>Then she crossed the room to her bed and stripped off the unremarkable black long-sleeved shirt she wore. Beneath it there was a bra, also unremarkable, also black. And the she started to trace her scars again. Not like a leader trying to show off, but like a prayer. And the line from Red Dragon floats through her mind again. Our scars have the power to remind us the past was real. She traces her history in those scars; thin fingers that look delicate tracing out her life in pain. The narrow, raised scars across the inside of her forearms. His name, she remembered, had been Rodney. In Seattle. Half-sharpened knives left such a mess. Her left side, three circles about the size of a cigarillo, with rays like a star-burst radiating from them. Chicago. Officer and pimp Edward Cujon. The bullets had deflected around her ribs, spun her like a rag doll. And then left before they hit the spine. She touched the matching exit wounds on her back.</div><div>Holy Mary, she began, and stopped herself. The faith hadn't done anything for her in the hospital, when the doctors had been removing pieces of steel that was still hot enough to turn her blood into steam in the operating room. She moved her hands to the two great keloid scars that ran from her shoulders to the small over her back in matched broad, curving lines. Like what you would get if your cut the wings off an angel, Bel had always thought. Two impressive lines of scar tissue and a bitter, bitter soul. And she didn't even have a name for that one. Just some anonymous person who hadn't quite had the hang of car bombs yet.</div><div>She took off her boots, socks, and ran her fingers along the bottoms of her feet, where she had spidery, delicate scars from running across broken glass in Minneapolis. The raggedy jeans she tossed into a corner before fingering the only marks on her body that Bel would have called deliberate torture, along the inside of her thighs and disappearing into the boyshorts she wore. Black, of course.</div><div>And then she stood, and swept the summoning circle clean, and took the plain old blackboard chalk from where she had thrown it the last time, on top of the vanity. She chalked the circle out again, and the sort of ease that comes from long, long practice brought her to the end of the intricate scribbling with alacrity. Under her bed, there was a mini-fridge, which Bel opened. From it she drew a small polystyrene container that held dark vials of blood. Pigeon, and not fresh. But still, blood was blood and her little guide did have his appetites. She selected two vials and returned the cooler to the fridge.</div><div>Blood in one hand, Bel returned to the vanity and drew out a dull-edged, wavy-bladed dagger. Little fake gems sparkled in the hilt. There were instructions written in a dead language in a drawer in her desk, but Bel knew this wizardry by heart. It was a small magic. One of the least she knew. Stepping into the summoners circle, she lifted high the knife and blood. And she began.</div><div></div><div>The house had last been furnished in the late twenties, by the look of it. It wasn't that the tables were smugly ornate, or that the china and liquor cabinets cabinets had more than just ornamental locks. There was no profusion of Chintz or explosion of pink in the wallpaper patterns. There was no metallic sheen to the flowers on the molding. Simply, the house looked as if it had been furnished almost a century beforehand, and then rented to a series of thugs and brutes, little more than animals, who had proceeded to destroy everything in the building up to and sometimes including the interior walls.</div><div>Plaster dust covered everything. And if one were to wipe away the dust on Tuesday, by the following Tuesday it would be back not, perhaps, as thick. But every bit as determined. And while it was fair to say that the house had not been furnished, perhaps, since its construction, that is not  say there was no furniture. But it was furniture of the sort that a dog would select, given the chance. Low to the ground, broken down. Some of it did indeed appear gnawed upon. Bel handled it the way she handled everything: by being aggressively indifferent to anything not of immediate value, and merely aggressive toward such things as those which were of value.</div><div>This time of night, the low, rude, plaster-coated furniture –plaster coated because none among this pack of human animals would take the time to resolve or indeed, notice the abysmal state that prevailed upon the home—was den to a few of Bel's coterie, her Pack, as she called them. And as far as they needed to concern themselves, she was alpha bitch, and any other position was too low for her to bother herself with.</div><div>Dressed again, in her black shirt and ratty jeans and thick socks and boots just a shy step away from being comically large, Bel stood near a shattered window pane and breathed in the night air. Clear and sharp with the beginning of autumn, she could smell woodsmoke even though this was a city. The wind was just right to bring in the air from the suburbs, where people still had fireplaces. The stars were shining, glittering and glinting and twinkling at her pack, as they made their way to her house. The moon was wrong for a ritual night, but that made this night, this glorious darkness, just right to run down the town. Like their own little version of the Wild Hunt. Join or die, join or die, and gods and goddesses help whoever gets between them and their prey.</div><div>In they came, her wild hunters, in their ones and twos. She had gathered then all, gathered them in as if they were scattered pieces of a puzzle. Members of a family she half-remembered, or perhaps the wolf-kin they acted like. Almost Bacchae, though the men put the lie to that. A feudal court, each one of them a lord, them and their spear-carriers, the no-names, the cannon fodder by whatever name.</div><div>Jessica was a skeleton in silver. Thin beyond the point of whipcord strength, she was faster than a cheetah at full sprint, and the racket she set off with all of her jewelry would scare away most anything that wasn't human, and too stupid to be afraid. She looked like a demon. Pale face and long hair. Silver claws that might have been sharpened to an edge along the leading point. They distorted her proportions, made her hands look enormous. The necklaces she she wore did nothing to help, the large charms that swung from them diminishing her body, reducing her to a wraith, a skeleton in silver.</div><div>In dark silks and shiny leathers was Emily, her arms hidden under the sweep of a dark pelisse. The ring in her nose was a tastefully small, the silver wire wrapped around the shank making oblique patterns as it wobbled and shook. Her fingers were nimble and the designs she drew in flesh looked as if they could live by themselves, let alone be part of the person they were tattooed onto. When she laid down a line for their summoning circles, her hand was probative and, like the great masters of painting, just to proportion. She came from Abiline, which to her mind was less of a town than the papers made of it, and more of an overgrown remnant of the Dust Bowl.</div><div>Thomas called Tuomas had a milky complexion. Bel had drawn him out of Chicago and up along after her. Like a great bird of prey, he perched on the back of his chair. The curl of his fingers around his ankles were evocative of that same raptor's claws. His eyes were dark pits with bits of jet shining out of them. His hair hung below his jaw and, straight like a razor, cut with a razor to all sorts of lengths. A black head of dandelion fluff.</div><div>Mary  divined truth and lies through the medium of her scars. The open wounds on her arms and the patterns they took as they healed led her to more insights than any pack of tarot cards or casting of runes, of fews. Bel had once had power, or would have power, or did have power. So Mary searched out Bel, and followed her to Maple Brook. There was something about the whip thin, blonde woman that she could smell on the air. Something she could feel on her skin.</div><div>Wesley, Wes, 'Lay, with his hair slicked back, had been found in Boston. Bel had met him looking for ha'penny salvation and altered states of consciousness. He was a little thug and a little hustler, and more than a little aggressive beast. His coat was ragged and his boots were dusty, and in the dark of the dying Victorian house, he faded into the woodwork. Black on black, the rotting walls rested against his shoulders and embraced him like a lover.</div><div>When she had been searching through the Undercity of New York, Annalise had found her. After each almost broke the neck of the other, they had called a truce. And in time, something they could almost call respect had filled the gap between them. And when Bel had offered her a place in the rapidly growing circle, her wolf pack, Annalise had accepted. Serving as a lieutenant in what Bel was creating offered her chances she wouldn't have had elsewhere. Power. Safety.</div><div>Harald's hair was the color of ripe corn hanging to his shoulders. Tight clothes and loose shoes and a pair of leather gloves made him easily the most usual looking of the circle. From Santa Fe, he had an accent, but between the one he had brought in from Norway and what he had picked up during his stay in the west, it was quite singular.</div><div>Jessica, Emily, Tomas called Tuomas, Mary, Wesley and Annalise and Harald. And Bel, of course. Almost the youngest, certainly still young enough that one who knew no better would call her a girl, until such a one looked into her eyes. Those were timeless, and the depth that might once have lain in their liquid depths had long ago frozen into layer upon layer of blue glacial ice.</div><div>Bel, in her tattered jeans and too-big boots and her dark coat wrapped around her like a cloak, spoke to the room.</div><div>“What I've been looking for is here. I've found some of the last pieces for the ritual. It should work this time. We'll have our guardian. Our own personal hell hound watching our backs, forever.”</div><div>Nods circled the room. Annalise made no movement, just staring smoldering holes into her commandant. Bel met her gaze, held it until her lieutenant looked away.</div><div>“The bird man is here. You can all see his blackbirds hovering over the city like it's some kind of enormous corpse. And he's moving. More than just extending his protection over the city, he's actually residing here. Which means that there's something that he wants here.”</div><div>Emily stirred in her shadows and shining cloths. “If we find out what it is, we might be able to use it.”</div><div>Bel flicked the collar on her coat up, nodding. “And I know where he's staying. That's what we're doing tonight. I need to get into his home, and I can't do it, just on internal energy. So we need to raise some power tonight. Are you ready?”</div><div>They were, and so they did. A pack that was becoming the Pack, and they stood in an old Victorian house that was slowly falling to pieces, on a street that had long since given up hope, in a city that echoed with violence yet to come.</div><div></div><div> Hag’s Hearth</div><div></div><div>“ What is the true quest? What is it that we are searching for when indomitable longing comes over us and we begin to wander? How can we understand ourselves; our place in Nature; our place in life itself? Beats me, pass the pizza.”</div><div>-Willow, regarding the Meaning of Life</div><div></div><div>Willow was still sleeping when Kimberly woke, and he didn’t open his eyes when she stole out of bed. To ward off the cold, she donned last night’s pants and one of his sweatshirts. They chafed a little, but kept her warm enough as she walked down the stairs The light of a September morning filtered dimly in through heavy drapes. Under the drapes were old-style stained glass windows, the figures populating them had attenuated limbs and large eyes, staring out in luminous jewel tones.</div><div>They were divided into sections, she saw. Lining the east wall, the stained glass arches glowed softly, nine panels on the long stone wall. They featured, Kimberly noted, one man, and one woman, and a plenitude of crows, or ravens. In one panel, the man knelt, his shoulder-length hair almost covering closed eyes. And in another, he stood before some fantastical court, in shackles with his chin upraised. In the last, he stood centered, in a long, dark coat. His hands were empty, and above him flew two dark birds.</div><div>Kimberly shivered. Too eerie for her, the similarities between Willow and the man in the windows. Of course, she thought, he must have commissioned them. But still, it’s spooky. Or maybe more spooky. Kimberly shook her head, though, and returned to her evaluation of the room. Willow had strange and perhaps wondrous things scattered about, and she wanted to miss nothing in the forty-foot room. It looked almost like a feast-hall, with the vaulted stone ceiling.</div><div>The windows fit with the rest of the décor: that is to say, they were not the only things eclectic. The furniture in the living room was largely high and wide, with wings to catch the heat of the fireplace, situated at the north end of the room. On low tables near the windows were a battery of herbs, many of which Kimberly did not know. Those for cooking, however, were clustered on one large table at the far end of the room from the fire, nearest the kitchen.</div><div>The floor beneath Kimberly’s bare feet was made of smooth, broad boards of irregular length. Though she had no reason to know, they seemed to be oak. A little longer, and Kimberly was sure that they were. Quercas rubra, in fact, the common red oak. The baseboards and paneling, which rose four feet up the granite walls, were dark, ancient wood. She rapped her knuckles against them and, while reflecting that wood got harder as it got older –she sucked on the fingers she had bruised— it occurred to her that they were red cedar. Juniperus virginiana, they gave off a warm scent that clung to her fingers.</div><div>Kimberly meandered into the kitchen itself by pushing aside the tapestry that covered the doorway, tying it back with a braided cord fixed to the door frame for that purpose. It was a large room, with two islands in the center. The stove was gas, and the little blue pilot lights allowed Kimberly to find the light switch near the door jamb.</div><div>Smiling and satisfied –but for a little chafing—Kimberly began sifting through Willow’s refrigerator, pulling out the ingredients for her special spaghetti sauce. A few moments rummaging in the age-darkened, varnished cupboards yielded a box of angel-hair pasta, which Kimberly laid on the sideboard before taking up an Opinel knife and peeling a tomato.</div><div>“I see you’ve drawn the curtains. You must have noticed the glass.”</div><div>Kimberly dropped knife and tomato as she spun. The voice was not  Willow’s.</div><div>“Did you know they tell a story? Indeed, they do. It involves the crows, if that would pique your interest in my oratory.” A short, painfully blonde woman leaned against the door case, arms crossed under her small breasts. Her lip curled in scornful amusement.</div><div>“Who the hell are you, and what are you doing in my house?” The question rolled out of her before she could amend to herself that this was Willow’s house, not hers.</div><div>The figure stomped her comically oversized boots on the dark wooden planks of the floor and, as if reading her mind, replied “This isn’t your house, love. It’s his.”</div><div>“True enough, but I’m thinking you aren’t a guest he’d invite.”</div><div>“He doesn’t know me, love. Also, as for my name, I’m Bel.“</div><div>Kimberly bent to pick up the knife and tomato. “Bel? What kind of name is that?”</div><div>“Mine.” Her voice was icy. “Come here, let me tell you the story on the windows.”</div><div>Kimberly eyed the space where Bel had stood, watched the dust motes swirl in the disturbed air. She dropped the tomato on the cutting board, keeping the knife in her right hand. Kimberly jumped as Bel’s head reappeared. Just her head, poking out from the edge of the door frame. The blonde wore dark circles around darker eyes, and her platinum hair swung in long pale lines about her head. They framed her face severely and she stared back at Kimberly.</div><div>“Are you coming?” Her foul humor swung back around like a reeling drunk.</div><div>Kimberly mutely followed Bel into the living room.</div><div>Bel picked her way around the tables and chairs of the room, threading her way to the north end of the room. To the right of the fireplace, Bel drew her fingers across the window casement, tapping her fingernails on the lead. The panel depicted the man, and a girl who stood, somehow, inside a woman. The background was of green grass and a brilliant red sky.</div><div>“The story, then. I’m sure you want it, my dear, and I would hate to keep you in suspense. The story is of the prince of Fairy, and of his Queen, and of his betrayal.”</div><div>Kimberly bit, her curiosity rearing. “Whom did he betray? Or did he get betrayed?”</div><div>“Oh, he did the betraying, all right. He betrayed his Queen, his mother, and his sister, all in one. You see, his mother,” right here, “ Bel tapped the glass. “His mother was also his half-sister. That sordid tale, I won’t bother with. But anyway his mother was his Queen, and his sister. So he had lots of ties to her. Blood and loyalty should have kept him in line. But he was a Prince of Fairy, after all. Princes of the Blood are all the same. It doesn’t matter which blood.</div><div>“Then we move to the second panel, where you see the Prince and his mother, and a murder of crows. This shows him being taught the secrets of magic. The ceremonies and the wards and the signs to call and repel demons and other spirits.</div><div>“And here is where he gets his warlock’s familiars. A pair of ravens, molded out of the flesh and souls of his own brothers. If you look closely, you can see his mother-sister holding them down while he tears out their spirits.”</div><div>Kimberly shivered, and did indeed look closely. In the background was the dual shape of the Queen, her arms linked with those of two dark figures.</div><div>“Oh, but that’s just the beginning, love. We haven’t even gotten to the best part. You see, once the Prince was secure in his power, and had great control over the shreds of his brothers’ souls, he moved on his mother. He seduced her, bedded her, and when she slept, he used the hair from her head to cram her soul into the body of a ten year old girl.</div><div>“That was his mistake, love. See, it’s the body as has the power. Spirit and mind together only remember the forms, not the energy. It’s gods-be-damned rare for it to live in the soul. But you see, it did for her. So the great Queen rose up and fell on her son and brother. That’s this panel, the fifth. She had her power, and she knew in her heart that it was greater than his. They fought for years. About shredded the ethereal realms with their struggles. And in the end it was all for naught, on her part. She wasn’t the stronger of the two.</div><div>“But she had help. The crows, the ravens, the black birds of all kinds, they took her side. She took their aide, at that. It was utterly without doubt: she hated him, and threw in with those carrion-birds in order to kill him. When all was done, though, she couldn’t destroy him.</div><div>“The birds wouldn’t let her. They wanted him to live, for something. They held back the Queen, here, in this panel.” Bel ran her pale, thin fingers along the seventh window pane. “They held her, and they fought her power. She wasn’t weak, for all the fighting she had done. She still had strength after fighting her son to a standstill. The blackbirds took her, though. The ravens, the most powerful, least numerous, did it in the end. Dictated the terms to her and him alike.</div><div>“He would live, but he would kneel before his Queen in chains. He would live, which galled the Queen, and he would kneel, which is a deadly thing to a Prince of Fairy. He would rather have died, but the blackbirds weren’t giving him the option.</div><div>“And after he knelt in chains, he would shed his shackles and do as they wished. He became their agent. Free to roam as he would before and after their little chores. The Prince had two ravens set on him, as a reminder of the power he’d lost. With his warlock’s familiars dead, those birds were nothing but feathered handcuffs, keeping a constant watch on him. So he wrapped himself in shadow,” Bel caressed the long dark coat the final figure wore. “And he wandered, to be seen no more.</div><div>“So love, what do you think of my story?”</div><div>Kimberly shrugged, easing her way over to the hearth. It was made of thick granite blocks. Solid stone to ground her while she assimilated. She laid one hand on the mantle, which was also of stone, and licked her lips.</div><div>“It think it is twisted and perverse, and that you should be leaving.”</div><div>“Well, babe,” said Bel. “Twisted and perverse it is, but that’s not really my concern. I didn’t make it up. And about my leaving, I’ve got an appointment with the Prince of Fairy, don’t I?”</div><div>Kimberly laughed, a little. “You’re straight-up nuts, aren’t you? I know you’re talking about Willow, and let me tell you, I’ve seen all over the man. He’s not hiding any fluttery wings or pointed ears or any of that crap.”</div><div>“Oh, boasting, are we? Trust me, deary, that doesn’t mean anything, and I think it’s time you stopped stalling, and I went to see him.” Bel cracked her knuckles, smiling, “I don’t suppose you’ll mind me beating the light out of those dark little eyes. They look like a blackbirds eyes, almost. Are you a bird, then, deary?”</div><div>“I'm not a bird. And I might mind.” Kimberly’s voice quavered, and she sank slowly to her knees. She felt her fingertips drag across rough granite, felt her right hand touch the wood of a chair. Maple, a small voice whispered in her mind. Trying to brace her failing legs, her left hand abandoned the mantle, settled on the dark wooden floor. Rowan, said the voice. Then, as both of Kimberly’s hands rested on the floor, as they groped across the hearth, the voice spoke again. By the stone, hold.</div><div>“By the stone, hold,” Kimberly repeated the words, felt something suck at the skin of panic that floated over her mind like oil.</div><div>Bel froze, twenty feet away from her, two low tables between them. Then she chuckled. “I should have known that he wouldn’t bed anyone without power.”</div><div>Let the winds keep me whole.</div><div>“Let the winds keep me whole.” Another draining of her panicked energy, and she felt almost in control of herself. Kimberly stood.</div><div>Bel swayed as if she was in a gale. Her clothes flapped around her. The large-leafed plant on the table next to her sat unmoved. Bel muttered, shook her hands through the air, and left a red tracery where her fingertips had passed.</div><div>A sudden weakness swept through Kimberly and she fell, almost board-rigid, into the ashes of last night’s fire. She didn’t realize she had fallen, didn’t understand what she was seeing, until a coal burned through Willow’s sweatshirt and started in on her back. Then Bel was there, with her blonde hair so fine that the light passed through it, hardly picking up any color at all.</div><div>It was so dark, though. As if the sun had gone somewhere else to play. The jeweled tones of the stained glass were dim, gray. Attenuated light that barely highlighted Bel’s face.</div><div>Bel’s fist came up, drawing back.</div><div>And there was Kimberly’s hand, full of ashes and soot, hurling detritus at Bel’s eyes. Bel, who went over backwards screaming as a coal caught her somewhere sensitive. And Kimberly was suddenly dizzy in the darkness and lurched onto all fours, panicked to get away from the reek of her own flesh burning on the coals.</div><div>Get thee back from me, take thy feet from this home, let not your eyes fall again on my house-rowan, lest ye be blinded!</div><div>“Get thee back from me, take thy feet from this floor, let not your eyes fall again on my house-rowan, lest ye be blinded!”</div><div>A tall woman, dark and long-haired, stepped into Kimberly’s field of view. Sarah, from the party. Piecing-eyed and swift. The stone beneath her hands whispered the woman’s virtues, the seven-toned song of her soul. Beneath her hands, Kimberly found herself growing to trust the Sarah the stones told her of, the woman in black and silver.</div><div>There was a cartilaginous crack, and Bel, towering over Kimberly in her pain, went down backwards. The tall woman grabbed Bel by the shirt and ejected her through a side door that Kimberly hadn’t noticed before. As the door opened, birds flew in. Seven crows circled the room and settled on the backs of chairs.</div><div>Sarah turned toward Kimberly, making a face and wringing out her right hand. “Shouldn’t have hit her like that. Especially since it looks like I wasn’t needed, after all. I broke two fingers.”</div><div>“What? Who?” Kimberly shuttered her unruly mouth, and she began taking in details. On Sarah’s shoulders were two ravens. Corvus corax, whom she knew. Huginn on the left –always on the left, according to Willow—and Muninn on the right, always. The sound of hoarse calls all around her, crows and rooks and ravens and blackbirds-general, enough to blot out the sun. Dispersing now, their cries were unreal in the returning sun.</div><div>“What…the hell…just happened?” Kimberly’s dizziness was fading, and she pulled herself into a chair.</div><div>Sarah shrugged, walked to Kimberly’s side. She stuck out her hand. “Hell if I know. Name’s Sarah.”</div><div>“Yes, I…know.”</div><div>Sarah grinned, then sat in the facing chair. “So Willow’s been talking about me behind my back?”</div><div>“Something like that.” Kimberly smiled.</div><div>“Who’ve I been talking about behind their back?”</div><div>Sarah and Kimberly turned in their chairs to see Willow stumbling down the stair well. He was wearing yesterday’s pants, a fresh shirt in his hands. His hair was snarled, and stood up like ruffled feathers.</div><div>“Hello, Kimberly. Hello, Sarah. Is it perhaps true that I missed a certain amount of excitement?”</div><div>“You did that.” As Sarah spoke, both Huginn and Muninn took flight. Willow pulled on his shirt quickly, but the thin tee shirt wasn’t enough to keep the raven’s talons from him. He winced as their claws dug in.</div><div>“I see that Bel has made her debut. I had wondered how long it would be. I am glad to see that you are both unharmed by that poor occultist.”</div><div>Kimberly sat up a little straighter. “Wait, you knew that Bel was coming here?”</div><div>Willow nodded, smiled a little. “I felt it as soon as she came in the door. This is my house. Though you,” Willow closed the distance between himself and Kimberly with uncanny speed, “have apparently gotten my home to accept you. It’s been quite some time since it had a woman at it’s center. The Navajo say that ‘the beauty of my home extends from the woman’. It only figures it would tell you my life story before I get the chance.”</div><div>Kimberly shrugged, looked away to Sarah. Sarah grinned and stood, pushing at Willow’s shoulder.</div><div>“Back off, Bird-man.” Then to Kimberly, “don’t mind him. I think he gets dramatic urges sometimes.”</div><div>Willow laughed.</div><div>“Do you have a first aid kit, Willow? I burned myself when…Bel was attacking me.”</div><div>“Did you now? And where were you burned, babe?”</div><div>Kimberly stood, gesturing behind her. “My back. I’m sorry, this was your shirt, too.”</div><div>“Oh, my, I’m sorry you’re hurt. Let me see it.”</div><div>Willow bent and drew her shirt up past her burned in wound, probed the area, and then kissed the unmarked and suddenly painless flesh.</div><div>“Perhaps I am missing something, but I cannot see any burns on you. My shirt, yes, but not your skin.”</div><div>He straightened. On his shoulders, Huginn and Muninn flapped their wings to keep balanced. Willow turned to Sarah, briefly shook her right hand.</div><div>“Thank you for coming. I understand that Huginn and Muninn pulled you away from something?”</div><div>“Just a movie, Bird-man,” Sarah flexed her fingers. “I’ll head out now. See you. Nice to meet you again, Kimberly." Sarah waved briefly on her way out.</div><div>After she was gone, Kimberly turned to Willow, crossing her arms. “So…what are those windows?”</div><div>“Oh, they tell a story. Would you like to hear the truth of it?”</div><div>Kimberly paused, looked at him. His arms were folded, and he leaned against her chair. On his shoulders, Huginn and Muninn cocked their heads slightly, watching her. She bit her lip, stepped close to him.</div><div>“Tell me.”</div><div></div><div>Crucifixio</div><div></div><div>The syndicates are moving into the States</div><div>and the mob is moving to Russia</div><div>like ocean currents below the waves</div><div>they might shift their form</div><div>but function cannot change</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, As Above</div><div></div><div>Like spring to the city, night came slowly to Swett Street. Running east to west, it was always late when the skyline cut the sun off from the sagging, aging neighborhood. The houses that lined it were Georgian, long since converted to apartments. The rusting mailboxes riveted to their cracking boards had long since succumbed to the ravages of the elements, and held together as much out of habit as from any lingering, spray-paint infused structural integrity.</div><div>Whatever color the old houses had been painted in years past was largely lost, and over time the many shades had faded to dingy gray. Below that faded and peeling paint, the clapboard had turned silver along most of their length. Where they weren't silver, they were discolored with rot and rust. Below the boards lived more rot, and poured concrete that was falling apart. At the west end of the street, the wide end with streetlights collaring it. Come nightfall, they projected a sickly sodium-yellow light that acted as a warning. A demarcation separating the rest of the city from the darkness that lived on Swett Street.</div><div>And when night finally fell over the street, like spring making its way across the earth, things came to life. People began moving, animals skittered across the street, ill-defined shapes casting weird shadows. In thirty-four Swett Street apartment four, a boy who called himself Tuomas stirred behind panes of glass that had been painted imperfectly black. Fitfully shifting under freshly laundered bedsheets, a dream held him tightly in its claws. In the sixth apartment in the building, the highest point in the house, Mary looked up from her arms, where gauze and and electrical tape made a monochromatic double helix. Her bed behind her lay unmade, and she still wearing nothing but her bandages. The dresser opposite her bed was crammed with ritual supplies –herbs and daggers, candles and books and bits of oddment. Around the edge of the mirror were taped pieces of verse. Some were chants, some were songs. Some were the cryptic phrases Bel was given to uttering after one of her trances.</div><div>Near the mouth of the alley, the fourth house on Swett Street was home to Jess, and her skeletal form was swathed in black. Still early by her lights, she had not finished donning all of her jewelry. The silver claws to case her fingers, the chains and amulets to ward away evil, and all her little knives tucked into their tight leather sheaths. In another room, Jess could hear Annalise moving about her room, little shuffling sounds whispering of sleepy steps into wakefulness. Annalise did have trouble with the nocturnal schedule. But then she was young, and they often do.</div><div>In thirty two Swett Street, Bel was already prowling. The streetlights came on, and darkness was thrown back it as if by magic. Bel, in her home, winced as the shadows fell into sharp relief. The edges of the houses were obscured by night, and the stars did not come out.  Clouds fell quickly over the city, and Bel sent out her call, her group, her pack, came dribbling in. Jess and Mary, Toumas trying hard to seem more than his seventeen years and angry with his youth, Wesley and Harald and Emily. And others. Those without names to give, or who had not the power to make their names stick in the minds of the group.</div><div>The room had been a living room in a previous life, and much of its furniture was still present, falling to pieces and pushed against the walls. Where there had been open space against the walls, trunks had been pushed. There were chalk marks all over the floor, from where marks of dark ritual had been imperfectly cleansed. The trunks were closed, and bound with steel. There were no words spoken, save the soft murmur of their leader. Nothing intelligible came from her mouth as she stood in the center of the room. There was a pattern to her noise, but none present could make out her speech, or even what language was being spoken. The trance often came on her like this, all unknowing and almost coy as it sidled up to take her. There were times when her magnificent white blond hair fell across her face and she, in her mindlessness, looked like a ghost.</div><div>She fell to chalking runes and sigils on the floor. Circles she formed up around them, and then joined the circles to each other with lines of strange geometry. The others rose to their stations, taking up their blades and wands and candles. The candles they set at their feet, and took them up blades in their left hands and wands in their right.</div><div>“We are assembled,” said Bel. Sitting on the floor of the rotting living room, she could feel the attention of her audience on her. It was almost fanatical, and she felt betimes like the leader of a cult. But they, like she, just wanted safety. And if she commanded them, it was because she had the right by reason of power. She spoke again.</div><div>“You have done as I asked?”</div><div>Sounds of assent came from the forms perched on the ruined furniture arrayed about her. One by one, each brought forth the items they had been sent to procure for the night's ritual. Candles were produced, and blades, and other props that were to be used in everyday ritual. From the end of the room, then, was presented the crucial ingredients. A brace of live blackbirds. Bel drew her own dagger out.</div><div>“They are perfect. Well done.”</div><div></div><div></div><div>Swett Street</div><div></div><div> Throw another body on the fire</div><div>now the stink is burning out.</div><div>Corpses hung on poles with wire</div><div>gore-crows peck their dead eyes out.</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Gore Crows</div><div></div><div>A cold wind blew in late October, down the roads and through the alleys in Willow’s adoptive town. Beside Willow, Sarah Mason had the collar on her long, dark coat turned up and her hands buried in her pockets.</div><div>“How’s Kimberly?”</div><div>“She’s doing quite well.”</div><div>“I expected her to bug out after what happened with Bel.”</div><div>“She took my explanation better than I expected.”</div><div>“Something happened that you didn’t expect? Now I know you’re making things up.”</div><div>“I’m glad you have such a high opinion of me, Spooky Girl. But honestly, Kimberly was willing to take what I said at face value. That, or she thinks I’m a dangerous psychopath who needs to be handled very carefully. But I think she just took it well.”</div><div>The sun was going down, and as they walked away from it, Willow and Sarah picked up long shadows, their sharp-edged twins stretching away down Gemiens Boulevard. The red light before them lay as thick as paint across the run-down apartment buildings and three story rat-shacks.</div><div>“So she’s meeting us at Abu-Dee?”</div><div>Willow nodded. “She wants to dance with me. Somehow, I don’t imagine we’ll be dancing the gavotte. Which is too bad because I do so like the gavotte.”</div><div>“Did you dance it often when you were young?”</div><div>“Oh, no. But speaking of dances, do you know the origin of the sarabande? I thought it was hilarious when Philip banned it.”</div><div>“Philip who?”</div><div>“The Second.”</div><div>“What, Philip the Second of Spain? Apogee of the Spanish empire?”</div><div>“That’s him.”</div><div>They crossed into Water Street,</div><div>“Why were you spending time with him?”</div><div>“He played chess exceptionally well.”</div><div>“You know, sometimes I think my life would be easier if you just didn’t talk.”</div><div>“Oh, it certainly would be. But far more boring. And who likes a boring day?”</div><div>“I could live with it occasionally.”</div><div>They cut across into  Swett Street.</div><div>“But if I didn’t talk, who would provide you with such excellent set up lines?”</div><div>“Who said I need set up lines?”</div><div>“You keep telling me that I’m a great and powerful mystic. Shouldn’t I know something like—“</div><div>Their path was blocked. Five women were arrayed across the dog-leg alley. Their arms were folded, and their mien was not pleasant.</div><div>Sarah pulled up short, dropping into a boxer’s crouch.</div><div>Willow stopped some five feet from the central woman who was, of course, Bel. Her hair was long, and the shade of platinum white reserved for heroines and goddesses. The tattered leather jacket she wore billowed dramatically about her, highlighting her thin frame. The clunky combat boots she wore did much the same thing. The sun painted the wall to her right bloody, and left her in shadow.</div><div>“Where are you going,” Bel said, “so late in the day?”</div><div>“Go to hell.”</div><div>“Sarah, be calm.” Willow took a half step forward. “We’re going to Abu-Dee. Would you and your friends care to come with us?”</div><div>Bel shook her head. “No-o-o, I don’t think so. I think that instead, you have something to tell me about how you’re going to be leaving town. And about what you did last week in your house.”</div><div>“I’m sorry, Bel. I’m not leaving town any time soon, and all I did last week in my house was live there.”</div><div>“You know what I’m talking about. When I came in, and Kimberly started doing magic! That wasn’t her, it couldn’t have been. Which means it was you.”</div><div>“Magic? My dear, you shouldn’t believe everything you read. Magic is surely gone from this world, isn’t it?”</div><div>“No, don’t even try that crap. I might not be as strong as you, but I know magic exists. And your house has been there for years, but I could swear it hadn’t been there for years a month ago. How does that work?”</div><div>“I’m afraid that I’m not responsible for anything you saw that day. I wish I could claim credit for it, but it seems that the lady of my house has something of a hearth goddess in her. Who knew?”</div><div>Bel’s hand sank beneath her coat, moving rhythmically along something at her side. “Don’t try this with me. I am not someone you want to play games with.”</div><div>Sarah started forward at this.</div><div>“You put a hand on him and—“</div><div>Willow lifted one arm high, forcing Muninn so sidle further up his shoulder to maintain a grip. “No need, Sarah. Besides, look around.”</div><div>She did, and saw that around them there were suddenly more people. Across the mouth of the alley, seven figures were outlined in the scarlet sunlight. Two bulky, five slight. Closer, with the slow, careful steps of men who knew how to fight, were two large members of Bel’s cadre with chains wrapped around their knuckles.</div><div>Backing away slowly, Willow lifted his hands. “I think you should let us go now, Bel. We’re just passing through.”</div><div>Moving faster than Sarah would have credited her able to, Bel slapped Willow’s hands out of the way and took him by the collar, pushing him toward the shadowy edge of the alley.</div><div>Sarah’s eyes picked out odd details. The dust Bel’s boots raised. The way Willow picked his way carefully backward, sure of his footing despite the fact that he was being forced backwards. Around her, the darkly dressed, sunset-stained group that Bel had collected came closer. Sarah felt under her coat for her brass knuckles.</div><div>But as Sarah’s fingers closed, tightened around her weapons, Willow acted. Placing his hands above Bel’s elbows, he jerked them down and pushed away. Almost falling into the shadows behind him, Willow’s arms should have been waving for balance. Instead, he lifted Huginn and Muninn from his shoulders and threw them into the air, as if he were loosing a pair of hunting hawks rather than his dark birds.</div><div>Then he fell.</div><div>Back into the darkness, the shadow of the Victorian house, Willow fell. Sarah made an abortive step forward as if to catch him, and all of Bel’s henchmen took big steps toward her. So she stopped and waited for the crack of a head against stone. She waited for the sound of a body hitting the gravel. She waited for anything to happen, as Muninn flew smoothly with Huginn struggling behind him, poorly healed wing flailing.</div><div>And something happened. Between Bel’s stumbling steps backward and the birds’ scrambling flight, Sarah saw her chance. She slipped past one of the bruisers on her left and tapped his temple with her brass knuckles. He dropped, and as he went, Sarah was out from the trap. Her back was still to the street, but as much of Bel’s gang as she had seen was in front of her. Keeping them all in her sight, Sarah slipped a long, wickedly sharp knife out of a sheath in her boot. Behind her, she could hear Huginn and Muninn settle down on something. Their beating wings were no longer filling her ears, but she felt as if there were a thousand birds over her head, circling, circling.</div><div>When Sarah felt the hand on her shoulder, there was no hesitation. She spun on her heel and jammed the knife into the belly of whoever had grabbed her. Or, she tried. Somehow, the hand holding her knife would not move forward. Sarah became aware of a hand gripping her wrist. When she looked up, Willow cocked an eyebrow at her.</div><div>“I thought you got rid of this.”</div><div>Sarah could only shake her head.</div><div>“Oh well. If you could refrain from stabbing me, that would be very pleasant.”</div><div>“O-okay.”</div><div>Huginn and Muninn, making much of their time in the air, squawked as they alighted on Willow’s shoulders. The outline of Willow’s hand on hers became immediately apparent when he released her and the blood began to flow back into her flesh.</div><div>“I think that I’m leaving. Bel, do you have any objection to that?”</div><div>She only glared at him, from the shadows where he’d stood moments ago.</div><div>“How wonderful. Do try to have a good evening, won’t you?”</div><div>They walked away, out of the alley and into the gloaming.</div><div>Bel and her dogs watched and waited, circling in the bloody light of sunset.</div><div> </div><div>It was almost empty in Abu-Dee. Sunset wasn’t a popular time for clubbing. Sitting near the end of the bar, across from the main doors, Willow had the seats nearby largely to himself. On the edge of the bar, Huginn and Muninn sipped water from saucers and chattered loudly. The main lights were off, and a few sets of plain incandescent track lights illuminated the club. Willow, speaking with Robin Redsson at the bar, didn’t seem to be paying attention to Kimberly and Sarah, some distance away at one of the wrought iron tables that dominated the non-dance floor space in the building.</div><div>“So she’s got him by the collar, and looks like she’s about to snap his neck, and he sort of falls back into the shadows and he’s suddenly behind me, ten feet away. It was unreal.”</div><div>Kimberly nodded from behind her drink. “He’s…like that. I like it.”</div><div>“Don’t get me wrong, sweetie. I liked it too. What do you think attracted me to him in the first place?” Sarah shook her head, then shook the hair out of her face. “But do you know how often he does things like that?</div><div>“There have been years when all I’ve seen him do is make a quarter come up double-headed, or move a little faster than he should have to catch a cup. But then you show up and suddenly he’s throwing out the power like it’s candy.”</div><div>“What’s the power?” Asked Kimberly, already knowing. “Is that what I did last month? The wind and stuff?”</div><div>“That was…something else. Yeah, it was power, but you don’t know anything about it. You shouldn’t have been able to do it, Pansy. But Willow didn’t seem upset, and I trust him.”</div><div>“Pansy?”</div><div>“Yeah. You know,” Sarah pointed at Willow. “Birdman,” she pointed at Kimberly, “and Pansy. It’s what I think of when I look at you. Dark eyes and light hair. The brilliant blue of your drink and tanned fingers over it. Pansy.”</div><div>“How long have you known him, Sarah?”</div><div>“A long time. Is it ten years, now? I think it might be.”</div><div>“Not quite ten years, Spooky Girl,” Willow pulled up another chair. “We met in the spring, if you remember. Ten years ago this May.”</div><div>“It was the spring, wasn’t it?”</div><div>“It was. Why were you pointing at me? Do I have something on my face?”</div><div>Kimberly shook her head. “Nope. Sarah was just explaining my new name.”</div><div>Willow raised an eyebrow.</div><div>“Pansy,” Sarah clarified.</div><div>“Ah. Did I miss anything other than the renaming of my girlfriend, while I was getting drinks for the birds?”</div><div>Kimberly met Sarah’s eyes, and shook her head slightly.</div><div>“Sure did, Birdman. We were talking about Halloween. Thoughts?”</div><div>“I have lots of thoughts. Thoughts about the hallowed evening, though? It should be an active time.”</div><div>Kimberly bit her lip. “What do you mean?”</div><div>“It’s a holy day. The Christians,” Willow waved one hand dismissively, “were far from the first to recognize that. It’s not because ‘the veil between worlds is thin’ or any crap like that.” He interrupted himself to sip at the tea in his hand.</div><div>“Too hot. Anyway, there’s no magic reason why Samhain is special. It just is. Older cultures in this area thought there was something particularly fluid about Maplebrook’s reality, but really I haven’t found any place that didn’t seem to think it was special like that. Places like Chicago, New York, London, Paris –they all have fewer mystical happenings than you’d imagine, given their population, but it’s still way more active than out here.</div><div>“Of course, the fairies and other creatures that are willing to empower humans don’t like to go into cities as much as people do.”</div><div>“Birdman, you’re starting to sound like a textbook on the supernatural. A bad textbook. Tell her about some of the fun stuff that’s going on.”</div><div>“It’s hard to choose. But I do like the dryad ceremonies.”</div><div>“You just like those because they do them naked. Are there any new year celebrations you can take your girlfriend to, or are you planning on ditching her with the crowd that is merely human?”</div><div>“There is no such thing as a mere human. What did you want to do for Halloween, Kimberly? I feel like I’ve been monopolizing the conversation.”</div><div>“I don’t know. Do dryads really do their celebrations naked?”</div><div>“Only part of them. It’s supposed to signify the death of the old year, going naked into death as it came to life.”</div><div>“What he’s leaving out is the fact that there are a lot of July births among the dryads.”</div><div>“You know as well as I do that dryads have a gestation period of over three years. And it can seem longer, the way time goes in fairie. Remember Shannon?”</div><div>Sarah shrugged. “Good point.”</div><div>“Who’s Shannon?”</div><div>“Shannon is someone I knew back when I met Willow. She met a man in fairie, and has been pregnant the last six times I’ve seen her, over the course of six years. Thing is, only about two months have passed for her. That’s what Willow meant. Time can get kind of wonky in the border lands.”</div><div>“You realize that I don’t really believe that I did magic, and I’m starting to think you two are crazy, right?”</div><div>“Most people get that impression. But you’re not going anywhere.”</div><div>“Why not?”</div><div>“Because you won’t,” Willow broke in. “You don’t need to, and you don’t want to. I don’t need magic to tell when someone is fascinated. Don’t worry. We don’t judge.”</div><div>“Big words, Willow. How sure are you?”</div><div>“Depends, love. Are you going to get up and leave just to prove me wrong?”</div><div>“Stop knowing me so well.”</div><div>“Sorry. Comes with the territory.”</div><div>“I didn’t realize that ‘mad prophet’ was considered territory now, Birdman.”</div><div>“Of course it is. Watch.”</div><div>And he sprung to his feet and leapt atop the table, coat flaring dramatically. At this sudden movement, Huginn and Muninn cocked their heads and jumped into the air and flew to Willow, circling him as he declaimed.</div><div>“Behold! That which stands shall be made to flow, and the darkness be turned to light! The demons of the air shall become the angels of the earth, and in the wake of destruction that destroyed not shall a Protector come unto this place, and she shall be the next link in the Chain of Protectors passing back into time immemorial! Female to balance male, light to balance dark, decorated by death balanced against one comely in slaughter. Thus shall it be.”</div><div>Willow threw himself from the table, pausing to let the birds alight on his shoulders.</div><div>“So, girls? How did I do? Do I pass, and get to go on to proselytizer school?”</div><div>“I don’t think so, Birdman.”</div><div>“Oh, dear. What about you, Kimberly? Did you like my performance?”</div><div>“I don’t know. It was very energetic, but it didn’t sound believable at all. I think I have to side with Sarah on this.”</div><div>“You are absolutely no fun at all. My prophesy had everything in it. Stagnation turning into movement, evil to good, and in the end you got a guardian. What’s not to like?”</div><div>“You left out the ‘great enemy’ and ‘dark ally’ part. Every good prophesy needs those,” Sarah sipped from her Red Witch. “Besides, you were too specific about what would happen. Real prognostication is vague and misty, so the fortune teller doesn’t look like an idiot when events turn out differently.”</div><div>Willow replied, but his voice was lost in the suddenly overpowering sound of the stereo system. The lights snapped off, and Robin –in the control studio now, not tending bar—started up party lights in all the colors of the rainbow.</div><div>Kimberly left the remains of her blue, sticky drink on the table, and whispered in Willow’s ear.</div><div>Pulling Sarah onto the slowly filling floor, they danced.</div><div></div><div>It was well past dark when they left the club, and the temperature had dropped considerably. The birds fluffed up their feathers, and Willow pulled Kimberly close. Sarah zipped up her coat, stuffing her silver-covered fingers into the pockets. The wind whispered down the street,  smelling of rain and fallen leaves. The only light to be seen was the sodium-yellow of streetlights. Clouds darkened the sky, blotting out even the most determined stars. Occasional rumbles of thunder sounded, and the flickers of light between clouds gave snapshot pictures of Kimberly’s surroundings.</div><div>Flash.</div><div>The street, receding north and south. In front of them an alleyway, entrance to a maze of back streets and short cuts that milled around and passed through Swett Street, the bottleneck of the hidden city. And into that, Willow led them with quick steps.</div><div>Flash.</div><div>His green coat darkened to black in the yellow glare of the streetlights. But his hand under Kimberly’s jacket was warm, and the pressure didn’t waver as he led them into the darkness through which it appeared that he could see.</div><div>“Come on. It’s dark in there. We’d best be quick.”</div><div>They were quick, but before Willow could lead them out of the alley, Sarah heard footsteps in the night. At first, the steps were behind them, then beside, and Willow didn’t seem to hear.</div><div>“Willow…” Sarah’s voice was tense.</div><div>“Keep walking. The mouth of the alley is just up ahead.”</div><div>“But how did all the porch lights go out too?”</div><div>“I imagine that Bel had them knocked out. Right, Bel?”</div><div>A short distance ahead, a flashlight came on. In the reflected half-light, Bel’s long hair glistened, and figures around her prowled into the shadows.</div><div>“You’re right about that.”</div><div>“Now, what was it that you wanted?”</div><div>“I want power. You have it. Show me.”</div><div>“I told you before, I really can’t help you.”</div><div>Sarah slipped her hand into her coat.</div><div>“Birdman, you want her to step down, or I’ll step up.”</div><div>Flash.</div><div>“Don’t worry, Sarah, we’re not in any real danger.”</div><div>Throwing the flashlight to the ground, Bel stepped aside and pointed one hand at Kimberly. She reached into her coat and drew out a sword. The blade was short, heavy. Notches marred the edge, not completely polished away. The dull streetlights glinted on it.</div><div>“Is this real enough danger for you, carrion bird?”</div><div>There was absolutely no emotion in Willow's eyes. No hint of movement, no gentle smile. Huginn and Muninn perched like stone carvings on his shoulders.</div><div>“Put that away. Now,” and his voice could have softened iron or shattered steel. It was a voice to make the earth tremble.</div><div>“And what if I don't?” Bel swung the sword in a gentle arc, and it made a faint sound, cutting through the air. “What if I just decide to use this on you, on her: what will you do then?”</div><div>Willow lifted his eyes to the clouded sky.</div><div>“It looks like rain.”</div><div>Bel flashed him a glance as she lifted her blade. Wind from the dark night brushed her face, stirring her long, flowing blonde hair. She squinted at Willow.</div><div>“What?”</div><div>And the world went white.</div><div>A whip crack magnified a thousand times came with the light, and Kimberly would have been blown from her feet if not for the arm around her like an iron bar. She screamed, Sarah screamed, and she heard others crying out in fear or pain.</div><div>And when Kimberly could see again, the arm was still supporting her , and where Bel had stood was a scorch mark, a perfect starburst of char lay on the pavement. Next to it was Bel’s sword, twisted, broken, and glowing dully. The grip of braided leather was burning.</div><div>Willows voice was clear despite the ringing in Kimberly’s ears. “It’s dangerous to go around waving swords in the air, Bel. Do it less. We’re leaving, now.”</div><div>Glancing around as well as she could, Kimberly saw a figure that could have been Bel lay on the ground, steaming or smoking under the streetlights. Her formerly long hair was singed short and smoldering gently. A somewhat longer patch was burning with a cheery orange flame. As Sarah joined Willow and Kimberly, Willow made to stop next to Bel.</div><div>“I’m sorry.” And he knelt next to her, placing one hand on her forehead. “Feel better, little phoenix.” He extinguished her burning hair, crumpled it to dust. “It will be light soon enough.”</div><div>They left Swett Street.</div><div>Behind them, it began to rain. Bel lay unmoving on the pavement as the raindrops, like tears, soaked into her clothes.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Mechanical Animals</div><div></div><div>food-powered meat-machines</div><div>walking alongside people.</div><div>Human-looking creatures</div><div>carrying no soul.</div><div>How am I to know the difference?</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Jaded</div><div></div><div></div><div>They stood around her like sentinels. Like trillionths. Like monoliths. The six of them encircled her completely, standing close enough to touch, and there was no pity in their faces. Diverse in dress, but eerily similar in their expression. Closed, flat faces stared down on their fallen leader. Bel's face was blackened with char, as was her right hand. Her left seemed more or less unharmed, but steam and smoke rose from the length of her body. The majority of her coat smoked, and the edges flamed under the rain.</div><div>Laying still even as the fire ate at her, Bel blinked and felt the storm carry away her tears. She wouldn't have admitted their existence to any of the pack, but in herself she was honest. When the bird man had laid his hand on her in pity and put out that burning pain atop her head, she had started to sob. It was quiet crying, and she hadn't the energy for any of the more theatrical aspects of a storm of tears. She could not move, and so throwing herself about was out of the question, as was the pulling of hair although, she suspected, that would not be a possibility for some time to come.</div><div>Almost all she had the strength for was blinking, and she thought, in the flickering darkness of her own burning coat and the distant street light, that it might be best for the pack to think her still unconscious while she couldn't fight. Annalise had almost managed to take her while she was actually capable of fighting. She was a good enough lieutenant, but presented with power, well. It was best not to put temptation in her way. And Jessica was erratic enough that there was no telling what was going on in her mind. The best Bel could hope for was that the sight of their leader rising to her feet after being struck by lighting coming from clouds that hadn't been there moments before would improve their opinion of her. It certainly couldn't hurt her not unearned reputation.</div><div>Her muscles felt like they should have been buzzing. They were full of movement, though she could barely feel most of her body. It wasn't the energy of a good rest and a well-treated person. Rather, it was the sort of twitching, disjointed high one got after a thirty-mile footrace followed by no stretching whatever. She was felt as if she was shaking inside, but her muscles were stiff enough to snap. When she tried to flex her legs, they twitched for a moment and were still. After another moment, she tried with her fingers, and met with slightly more success in her left arm. The right she couldn't actually feel, and it was still smoking in places. Those fingers didn't move, and she felt a sudden thrill of terror, thinking about nerve damage and burn scars and loss of mobility.</div><div>The rain was cool. Where it touched her skin, the muscles felt even tighter, but in some places it was helping to extinguish her coat, whose flames were quite uncomfortable, even through her many layers of clothing. There was no sign of the rain letting up, and indeed, it even seemed to be picking up strength. On the pavements, Bel felt her heat leeching into the earth. The cracked tar under her cheek shifted slightly when she tried to move her head, and the swiftly soaking sand and grit stuck to her face. It was on its way to mud, and the sandy mess contrasted sharply with the lines of char, of burned and crisped skin, that radiated from her chin to several points on her hair line.</div><div>Ultimately, as feeling was beginning to reassert itself in her legs—though her right arm remained stubbornly unresponsive—it was the feeling of chilly stares on her that brought Bel out of her silent catalog of her injuries more than the rain slowly saturating her clothes. There was a slight movement that she thought she detected, lying on her back. The circle contracted slightly. Its members moved closer by half a step and one made it a full step. From the chiming of silver, it would be Jess. Skeleton in silver, clawed monster of the Pack.</div><div>She was still for a long minute. Lying on her back, with her legs twisted to the side, she stirred. She rolled over slowly and pushed at the ground. She pushed it away with mixed success, and made it to her knees with some trouble. She stood, swaying. Her knees sagged together, and she tried to move her right arm. It sort of flopped about and when she found herself</div><div>“You need a hand the rest of the way up?” Jess. It was Jess' voice Bel was hearing, through the ringing of her ears. Perhaps she was underwater, she thought, and shifted her head about drunkenly, looking up at the woman. Her right arm still wasn't working, it was still, if she thought about it, smoking a little bit. Or maybe steaming. The rain cooled her face, and since the right arm wouldn't move, she lifted the other to take Jess' hand.</div><div>“That sounds...” She paused, and then shook her head: it started spinning. She stopped shaking, and cleared her throat. She coughed then. “Yeah, help me to bed. Get some water. Bring it, too.” Her voice was slurred even in her own head.</div><div>Jessica took her hand, carefully repositioning her hand mid-grasp to avoid slicing Bel's hand open. When she had a good, firm grip, Jess turned the inside of her leader's wrist upward, and lifted straight up. It pulled Bel upright, and also put her in a straight-arm joint lock. Bel's legs came straight, and she locked her knees because she didn't think her legs would support her otherwise.</div><div>“Can you stand on your own?”</div><div>Bel felt the twanging pain in her arm and gasped, then involuntarily lurched forward and vomited copiously all over Jessica's pants and shoes.</div><div>“God damn it!”</div><div>She cocked her fist without thinking and drove her fist out and into Bel's face. She dropped her leader's locked out arm and let her fall to the broken pavement. She fell like a great tree hewed off at the base. Her head bounced off the earth and her left arm landed under her. Something made a grunch sound, and the thin, dark-eyed girl cried out and the arm she'd fallen on bent oddly.</div><div>Jessica stared down at her pants, covered in whitish, sticky, smelly goo, and shook herself, trying to free some of the worst muck from her clothes and shoes. The rest of the statues about the circle had wavered and taken half a step forward when Jess made her attack, but now they were hesitating as she glared at them, and at Bel. Those sharp blades on her fingers, and hidden knives up her sleeves, were making the others say nothing very, very carefully. They might be able to take her, but no one was eager to try it out. Jess turned aggressively to there rest of the group, gesturing to her legs. Bel half-rolled over and managed to fling out her right, charred arm to grasp Jessica's ankle.</div><div>“...Bed. Bucket. Take me in,” her voice was weak, and had the distinct mushiness of someone trying to speak through a mouth full of vomit. She couldn't really feel anything with her right hand, but as long as she kept one eye closed, her vision was only encircled by a ring of black rather than large, shifting black bars and fuzzy colored spots. Staring at the vomit-spattered ankle in her hand, she tightened her grip as much as she could. She had to make them listen. Had to sleep. Had to get strong again, tough again.</div><div>“What? Oh, fuck you. I'm not doing shit for you. You want something, get it yourself. Or make me,” Jess taunted. “You want it, you can go ahead and make me, if you can even stand up on your own.” Seized by some evil whim, Jess drew back the foot that the sloe-eyed woman wasn't clutching to kick out. Bel saw the foot going back and tried to clutch tighter. She wasn't sure if it worked, but the sudden rush of adrenaline let her twist her legs. Her hand held and as she rolled away, Jessica's leg slid out from under her and robbed her kick of its force.</div><div>Jess hit the pavement with the full force of her weight, which was not much, and uttered a sputtering cough as she lost her breath. Bouncing back quickly, she rolled aside and swung a kick at Bel's head. It did not miss, and Bel's tight, tormented muscles snapped back against its force. She pushed with her knees, and continued the roll away from Jess. Bel pushed with her right shoulder and pulled back with her legs, dragging herself to her knees. Stepping forward, Jess raised one hand open in a claw, and bounded forward to rake the sharp edges across Bel's face.</div><div>But seeing those sharp blades coming Bel twisted away and upward, taking the raking blow across her her ribs and breasts, striking at the hand with her mostly numb burned forearm. It spun Jess away in one direction, and Bel away in the other. Staggering back a few steps, Jess turned back to her opponent, who spiraled to the ground. This time, she kicked from further back and connected well. There was a cracking sound, and Bel made something that might have been the difference between a scream and a moan. She rolled away, her right arm clutching at her ribs, and stumbled back to her feet.</div><div>I can't take her like this, Bel thought to herself. She kept backing away from Jess, who moved in like an angry wolf. Moving around the edges of the circle, she didn't try to push past the others in the circle. If she ran, they would all be after her, just like a real pack of dogs. She tried to shake out her charred arm, but it would scarcely move at all. The other arm would shake from the shoulder, but nothing below the elbow would so much as twitch.</div><div>Her head still felt as if she were under water, and her ears were buzzing. She shook it again, and waited for Jess to move in. Her vomit-spattered legs were spread in a rangy stance, and swung her hands out like a wrestler trying for a clinch.</div><div>When Jess moved in, Bel didn't wait for those sharp hands. She dropped her shoulder and threw herself forward, catching her opponent in the stomach with head and shoulders, barreling her to the ground. When Jess pushed as her legs, Bel pulled one of them up high and brought it down as hard as she could. Something gave under her heel, and Jess' squirming slowed abruptly. Bel kicked down again, and the moving stopped altogether.</div><div>After some time without Jess attempting to move again, Bel kicked down again, as hard as she could. Whether or not she had been faking it, she wasn't anymore. Rolling over, she pushed herself to her feet. She could almost feel the fingertips of her right hand, but she couldn't really move it. Her coat was no longer afire, and one of her legs was sort of twinging as she tried for a long stride toward her home. She didn't manage a long stride, but she didn't fall down either. In that way, she made her way to the porch.</div><div>Her arms hanging uselessly beside her, Bel mounted the stair. She breathed shallowly and held herself upright, shaking very slightly.</div><div>“Go home. Go home now.”</div><div>And Bel went inside. The door creaked quietly shut behind her. She leaned against the wall, head tilted against the jamb. Outside, the characters in her own morality play, after some time, walked away. She slid down the wall and as she tilted over, resting full body on the floor, passed out.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Karmacode</div><div></div><div>Can you feel me in you?</div><div>Don't you know me, honey?</div><div>I'm the hate in your curses</div><div>I'm the venom in your voices.</div><div>Feed me your dreams</div><div>Feed me your fire</div><div>I need a sacrifice</div><div>I need a sacrifice</div><div>Will you be mine?</div><div>Be my sacrifice</div><div>Be my sacrifice</div><div>Will you be my sacrifice?</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Burnt Offerings</div><div></div><div>In his home on Paradise drive, Willow watched Kimberly sleep. And then he slipped out of bed, careful to tuck the covers back around her body. There was no light in the room save for what starlight leaked in around the heavy drapes, but Willow had no trouble seeing as he stepped around piles of books, making his way toward the wardrobe. He pulled a light robe from the wardrobe and donned it as he left the room. As he turned a corner and ghosted down the stairs, Willow felt the twin weights of Huginn and Muninn settle on his shoulders.</div><div>“Hush, little birds. This shouldn't be too dangerous, and we all know it has to be done. She is far too good for this little burg, and there's no one but me to keep her in line. She certainly doesn't know enough to keep herself in line.”</div><div>He walked down the short couloir and entered his living room. The curtains were drawn in this room as well, leaving the may large, wing-backed chairs to be the focus of the room. The chairs were as stars, with low Turkish tables orbiting them in the fashion of planets. In patterns of their own, a plenitude of vegetation flourished atop the tables. Willow absently adjusted a rosemary plant that Kimberly had used earlier in the evening. He slid it an inch to the left, and then touched in turn the sage, dill, and oregano plants that shared table space with it. If lines were drawn between the plants  in a particular configuration, across the thickly lacquered table top, certain runes would be seen to form.</div><div>Willow circled the room from its eastern side. By the kitchen, he slid a chair backwards, and then altered the position of the tables acting as its satellites. Moving southward, he touched only the occasional plant, and moved a single table. The whisper of his bare feet over the floors and the squeak as he cajoled furniture into the proper positions were the only sounds in the room. The ravens remained silent, motionless sentries content to sit on Willow's shoulder as he went about his work.</div><div>By the time he had finished, a space was clear in the center of the room, and he approached it. As he settled himself into a yogic position, the ravens stirred and uttered low cries. At this, Willow sighed and spoke.</div><div>“If you have no stomach for this, then leave me to my work. If she releases her creature tonight then people will certainly die. Fewer perhaps, than would find their deaths if she continued to build her power and drew together her guardian in the manner prescribed by my rituals, but if she releases the beast now, then I will not be able to catch it. I'll not have another one of these things let loose to stalk the minds and bodies of those I love.”</div><div>Now anxious, the covidae shook their wings in protest and cawed. Willow lifted one arm to mute their cries to carry no further than his hall. He didn't want to wake Kimberly.</div><div>“I know that this could turn it into a zero-sum battle. I accept that. If I have the time to pull together my allies, then I will win such a battle. If you but lend me your aid, then we will prevail. Or if we do not prevail, then you can keep us from failing utterly, which is all that we need at this juncture. Bel will have to spend the time charging her beast further, and empower it beyond the normal span of the year. She won't be able to let it out until after the new year is well and truly begun. If nothing else, that would rob it of some power –not being able to hunt during the time when one year is ended and the other has yet to begin will hurt it, slow it. If nothing else that circumstance might serve to confuse it.</div><div>“So, will you lend me your aid in this?”</div><div>The ravens were silent. Preening their feathers unconcernedly, they indicated their assent either by their protests, or with some supernal communication. Willow nodded to each of them in turn. Resting the backs of his hands across the robe and his knees beneath that, he closed his eyes. He dreamed.</div><div>And in the darkness, the runes Willow had made filled up with light.</div><div></div><div>Kimberly dreamed...</div><div>And in her dream she wore robes of ruby and onyx, and her skin was green as the emerald of the soft growing parts beneath the bark of a tree. Her very flesh felt firmer to the touch, as if she herself were wrought of xylem, and reinforced with layers upon layers of lignin. Her limbs bent with all their own suppleness and when Kimberly was lief to touch her toes, which were unshod and clad with no stocking, she felt as if there was the springiness of birches in her bones. When she wriggled her toes down into the earth that rooted the grass beneath her feet, she felt as if the very sky could fall down on her and leave her unmoved, for the power of the bones of the earth was in her.</div><div>And through that earthly, immeasurable strength that worked on her mind as well as her body, she began to see the rest of that place she was in, which had heretofore been concealed from her. She stood in a glade with a pool fed in its lowest depths by a sweet spring. The sunlight was not showering down on her face, for a green canopy like the ribs and roof of a cathedral covered over the top of the clearing. The trees were varied, but they were summer trees that were long quit of the touch of cold and winter. She saw oak and ash, elm rowan and maple. Their limbs bent as if in greeting, and Kimberly felt no wind.</div><div>It came to her as she regarded the glade, with the eyes that were in her body and the eyes that the land gave to her, that she was not alone. Kimberly looked to the north and saw a man of princely proportion, who wore about him a robe woven of air and the greenness of the wood. His skin was as the craggy face of an oak tree whose roots are deep, and above the man flew an omen of ravens. From east to south to west to north they flew, and then back to east to start again. They made themselves into a great circle of birds. Around and about they winged the circumference of the man's reach, making themselves into an awful and fearsome crown. Their power sparkled in the man's eyes and, already dark with knowledge, they were made darker still and terrible with the strength of the birds in them. Feathers and beaks and all that was of the blackbirds moved at the direction of the man in the center of their circle. His very body radiated age, experience, and authority.</div><div>And when he spoke, his voice echoed with deep caverns and night air, and she heard in his voice something she would have called love, if she had known the identity of the stranger before her wearing the mantle of godhead.</div><div>“Kimberly, I am sorry to ask so much of you so soon, but there is no other way. So much is happening, and I cannot explain. Will you join your strength with me to defend innocents?”</div><div>“Who are you,” she said. “Who are you to speak so to me, she who is of the land?”</div><div>He with the mantle of power about his shoulders laughed, and in that instant she knew him and was struck at once by a great confusion.</div><div>“Willow,” She said. “What is going on?”</div><div>“Danger. Pain and fear and power are abroad this night and unless they are chained they will be the bane of those who have earned no vengeance.”</div><div>“I don't understand,” Kimberly said, feeling her way through the earth. She knew from deep in her that he spoke words that were true, and she tried to fond the where that was linked to the what of danger. She dug inside herself futilely searching for it, a nagging emptiness where knowledge should have been.</div><div>“Pain, as I said. Pain and fear, in the hands of one with a great deal of power. Paranoia rules Bel, and unless we act, she is going to feed everyone to it, including herself.”</div><div>“How can paranoia be dangerous to us?”</div><div>Willow shook his head. “This is a time for action. I will let you see inside me, and it will be easier for you to understand.” Then he hesitated. “There is no going back from this. If you take my hand now, in this place where you are Mistress, you will know much of me –even things I might not show you, given my own choice. And I will have the same view of you. Such things are seldom pretty, and I have made many decisions that are...not sources of pride.”</div><div>Kimberly felt caution, and saw the brittleness behind the eyes of the man with the princely frame and the crown of dark birds and the mantle of power about him. And she took him to her and said:</div><div>“Show me what to do.”</div><div></div><div>Sarah dreamed...and stirred, as if to wake. Then she came to herself in dreams, and sat up. Then she stood and saw herself in a clearing floored with springy grass and walled about with the boles of great trees. To one side was a pool of water dark with secret knowings. And she looked to the man who was there, and his crown of blackbirds, and she sighed.</div><div>“Is it as serious as all that, Birdman?”</div><div>He nodded, and an unseen wind blew through his hair, disturbed the folds of his cloak. “Every bit, Spooky Girl. I've been doing my best, but this is dangerous. And if Bel does what she's intending. Well, it will be bad. Worse than Tribola and Alea.”</div><div>Sarah heeled around and crossed the clearing. “Please tell me you're exaggerating. Those cities were burned to the ground, and we still haven't met anyone from either of them since it happened. What could be worse than that?”</div><div>“I could,” he said. And Willow stepped away from the trees to the pool. He knelt on its bank and drew a hand through its dark waters.</div><div>“Clarify that statement,” she said flatly.</div><div>Willow shrugged, and spoke from his squatting position. “I worked certain spells in my youth, to isolate parts of my personality. To tie them off, as it were, like a limb to be amputated. And then I wrote other spells to help with the amputation.”</div><div>“How could you do that –why would you ever do that?” Sarah asked in shocked horror. To destroy parts of an—arguably—impeccant human was almost the definition of what Willow stood against.</div><div>Willow shrugged again and rocked back on his heels. “I was young, and foolish, and I saw the darkness in my heart. And so I tried to make myself...better. And I excised the darkness, and made myself into the image of virtue in all things.”</div><div>“That sounds like an ugly jumble of everything you've counseled me to avoid, myself.” Sarah clenched her hands into fists, then relaxed them. “How did it turn out for you?”</div><div>“In retrospect, predictably. Parts of oneself are, after all, still a part. By disconnecting them one does not –I did not—actually kill them, as with severing a limb. I just removed all the constraints placed upon it by the rest of myself. And when that dark part of me turned up, with all the darkness and power it had gathered since I cut it out of my soul?”</div><div>Sarah flickered an eye at the dark bids that circled Willow in a ring of building power. “It was as strong as you were?”</div><div>“Stronger.” Willow shook his head. “At first we drew from the same well. My self, my body and mind. We were the same person, saving only the moral inclinations. And then he and I separated somewhat under the influence of my spells of excision and my meditations on truth—Truth, I should say, because I was still young enough to believe in that idea, and the capital letter that came with it—but never completely. And as it grew in strength, found itself a body, took on the aspects of its power, it came for me –as it had to.”</div><div>“Why did it have to? If you were mostly separate, why did it return?”</div><div>“Because that was its nature. It was hate, and it was fear and jealousy and everything else that makes us...less. Or so it was that I thought. But without a focus, it was just directionless, without meaning, possessing little will of its own. If it had destroyed me, or absorbed me into itself, dominating my will, and the good in me, it would have become,” Will molded the air with his hands, drawing a sphere before him. “A thing unto itself. A wholeness with its own direction and identity. No longer dependent open another –namely me—for its life.</div><div>“So it came to kill me, cook me, and eat me. In a manner of speaking.”</div><div>“And you won,” Sarah stated. “I mean, you're here, so you won and defeated your evil twin. He's gone, and I don't have to start looking over my shoulder, right?”</div><div>Willow looked at her strangely, as if she had completely missed the point. “No. Of course not. He was stronger than I was, knew more than I did, and had no honor at all. Of course I lost. I had the help of the blackbirds and Marilka my wife, the trees, and the land itself, and I lost. And I died.”</div><div>“But you can't have lost. You aren't all evil and murdering, and you certainly aren't dead. You're no ghost; we've run into ghosts before, and you aren't one. So how did you win?”</div><div>“I repeat: I did not win. I lost, and I died, and that was that. Almost.”</div><div>“Ah-ha! I knew there had to be an almost!”</div><div>Willow nearly smiled. “I tried, before the end, to take the darkness into myself. Well, technically my wife tried it. And in stopping her, I did.” Willow sighed, and raked his fingers through his hair. “The spells I had used, the nature of the separation...didn't react well to reintegration. Especially not a forced one. Especially with no preparation.”</div><div>“And then?” Sarah said, fascinated, or horrified. She didn't know which she was feeling more. But for the moment, fascination held the edge.</div><div>“Like I said, I died. But not completely. My body was still there, but my mind was gone. No heartbeat, no thought, nothing. But my body didn't rot, and nothing could mar it. I'm told that it cause quite the commotion when they tried to burn my body, as was the custom. I awoke one morning thirty years later, inside a granite mausoleum. I can remember nothing so beautiful as that sunlit day.” Willow looked to the sky above, hidden by leaves that looked lit from within, glowing green. Far out on the pond, near the center, a lone shaft of sunlight fell on its still surface.</div><div>“That's it, you just woke up?”</div><div>“After being dead for thirty years, mind. That's a long time. And I wasn't the same man. You know me as Willow Gray, and that's my name, now. But it wasn't before, and I am not the same. 'More and less and different than I was',” he quoted. “I don't know where I heard that, but the day I read it, I knew it was exactly the right description for myself. I am not who I was. In some ways I am more, and less. But mostly I am different. The man who got up of that catafalque was not the same one who was laid down on it.”</div><div>“What,” and Sarah paused, unsure which question to ask first. “What was your name, before?”</div><div>“Wrong question, and not one I'll answer.” Willow closed his eyes briefly, taking a visibly deep breath. “Try another.”</div><div>“Then, do you remember being dead?”</div><div>“That's a good question. Not really, because I didn't die all the way. No bright lights and floating into the heavens for me. See, who I was, the man I was, had been shattered. And while I lay there dead on the earth, there was still a part of me that was me, and it still wanted to live. I spent the years of my death searching for all the parts of myself that I could find, and fitting them back into my identity.”</div><div>“Is that why you say that you're a different man, now?” Sarah asked, cannily.</div><div>He nodded. “That's one reason.</div><div>He nodded. “That's one reason. Another is the fact that I don't really remember much of my time alive as I lived it. Everything is seen through a shroud. See, I've got my whole life in my mind, but its from two different people at minimum.”</div><div>“What do you mean, do you have two people's lives? Did you get somebody else mixed into your rebuilding?”</div><div>Willow laughed, then shook his head. “Not at all. It's all me, but the question is: which me? See, my ritual had been designed to break the bonds that my self had, holding itself together. And when I fought my, what did you call it, my evil twin, all the bonds holding me together fell apart. My sense of identity drifted away like an summer breeze or a wisp of cloud. And when I managed to put myself back together, each and every event in my life was viewed through a double dozen viewpoints—at minimum.”</div><div>“Oh, god.”</div><div>“Exactly. I don't just have memories from one lifetime, I have dozens. From the 'good' me, from the evil one, from one obsessed with love, or carpentry, or green bottle-glass, or cooking, or Marilka...” at this last, he paused and squeezed his eyes shut. After only a second, he opened them and the pain was gone from his voice. “And there were others. So many others. And thus you see the problem I had. Which account was correct? The evil, suggesting that all my actions were for my own benefit, and that this was correct? Or the good, which protested that everything I did had been for the best, to serve a higher good? And on, and on, and on.”</div><div>“So you're more like hundreds of people –thousands!”</div><div>“No, I'm like one person, stitched together from thousands of people, with a tiny scrap of material from each one. Like that hypothetical person, I'm mostly stitch marks. What makes me who I am is usually not the events themselves, not the scraps. Rather, it is the interpretation that I put on those events that defines me, the way that the manner of attaching the cloth would show what it was, rather than the whole piece. It only has a function as part of a whole, and I only have meaning as I analyze myself. Or rather,” he added with a self-deprecating laugh, “I used to. Now, of course, I've had experiences of my own, and made choices of my own, and lived my own life. It's not the same life I would have lived as—as who I was. But it was a life, which is what matters.”</div><div>“That still sounds,” Sarah shook her head. There were no words. She settled for a lesser description. “Horrific. At the least.”</div><div>“And you don't even know what I did before I came back to fight myself,” Willow said grimly. “But I get to remember all the things the shadow-I did with a single viewpoint, and know only those impressions as the real ones. So you understand then, why I am so very determined to fight the creature.”</div><div>“I understand. But what could it do to anyone else? I mean, you're really strong, and these characters on Swett Street are mostly a pack of losers.”</div><div>“Oh, Bel has power enough. So do a few of the others. Annalise and Tomas, particularly. But Bel it the notable of the group.”</div><div>“Accepted, but my point is, they aren't going to cause and great strife in the world beyond the physical, are they? You know; smaller talent, smaller mess?”</div><div>“I see where you're going with this. And you are correct, to some degree. But there are several things that prevent this from being the case. Firstly, the loss of any life is something I want to avoid. My own half-life was traumatic enough, and I wish it on no person. Secondly, Bel has a great deal of influence, and she has brought a large number of individuals in on some of the lower levels of the ritual without imparting the full details to them. So they are part of it whether they will it or no. Thirdly, I fear that they have not cast all of my spells well, or completely. Therefor there are certain parts that have been crippled or thrown out entirely. They have very little control of the monster they are creating, and it will feast at random, from whomever it chooses.”</div><div>“My, but that doesn't sound ominous at all.”</div><div>“I see you've been working the sarcasm muscles lately.”</div><div>“Fifty biting remarks every morning before breakfast. And it keeps my figure trim, too. But honestly, how are you going to stop this without, you know...”</div><div>“Killing them?”</div><div>“I was going to say 'nailing them to a wall', but your version will probably sound better for posterity. So yeah, let's go with that.”</div><div>“I don't want to kill them. And I'm not entirely sure it will kill the creature, either. Like I said, they didn't do my spells right. Which means that we might be dealing with something that has only a superficial relationship to my intended casting. But no matter how they've changed it, the damn thing is dangerous. And we have to fight it now.”</div><div>“Now? They did the ritual tonight?”</div><div>Willow shook his head. “They've been doing it in portions. That's how it's intended. A gradual loosening of bonds followed by the severing of them. But they are coming to a point where the creature will act independently to maintain itself, and empower itself.”</div><div>Sarah shivered, tried to keep it hidden. “And how will it do that?”</div><div>“It depends on exactly how it was created. But as a rule, it will go after people who show large concentrations of the emotions used to create it.”</div><div>“Um, what?”</div><div>“If it's a fear demon, it's going to eat fear. If it's a lust demon; lust. If it's a pain demon...”</div><div>This time Sarah's shiver was physical. “At least we'll know if it's free. A sudden spike in suicide rates and ER visits.”</div><div>“If such victims even make it that far. But yes, you are substantially correct. And you see the reason it provokes such terror in me.”</div><div>“I see it, but what are we going to do? Without killing these stupid children, what can we do?”</div><div>So Willow told her.</div><div></div><div>Robin dreamed. And in this dream, he stood before a man who he knew without question was Willow Gray, though this creature before him drawn from the wild wood looked nothing like the man himself.</div><div>Leo dreamed. And he was the fourth called into the dream. He knew it must be so for there could only be one of the five who stood before him, doing the calling. The woman with a skin of fresh green and the vitality of spring was formidable, but the flavor of danger and excitement came from the man who stood calmly before him. To one side, he recognized Sarah with a start. He never dreamed about people he knew.</div><div>Annie dreamed. And she felt herself drawn into the web of Willow's devising, and let herself go. When she woke, standing, to the sight of a clearing, she felt no surprise. The presence of Leo and Robin and Sarah did unsettle her, though Sarah seemed more at home here, less like someone who had been dragged out of bed and more like someone who had come, knowing the path. She turned to face Willow Gray.</div><div>They dreamed, and they were awake, they were more and less and different than they were in the waking world. And with little enough argument –for this was a dream, was it not?--the three summoned, innocent mortals agreed to fight for justice, and right, and most of all for the lives of the innocent. And the lives of the guilty, Willow thought, he could fight for himself.</div><div>So he gathered them together in a great circle about the pond that held bright secrets and darkest truth, and he drew them to the plain of bones, where the dead lived, waiting for release, and for oblivion.</div><div>Bel dreamed, and the tossed in her bed, and felt the tickling of minds other than her own moving in her dream, and sliding around her private darknesses. She thrashed in slow motion, tangled in her bedsheets, and her nightmare grew in intensity. She whimpered in the back of her throat, and the bonds of dirty linen transformed into chains of iron in her mind. She pulled against them and was wound tighter into her mind, and the intrusion was painful, forceful, and she knew that it was not of her own devising. When she screamed and bolted up, it was not into the waking world she rose.</div><div>She was on the plain of bones, where she was to die and live again. Where she had to have already died, and already lived. Otherwise, what were all these bones that reached from one horizon to the next, and as deep as ever she could dig? These were the bodies of her past, the bodies she would live through and had lived through. And at the center of this unknowable plain was her watchdog. Her safety net. Her bulwark against the vagaries of the world. And it was hungry.</div><div>But it was not alone, and it should have been.</div><div>This creature had no form save that which she gave it; the highest lady and mistress of its power, she could command it to take whatever form pleased her. Typically, she left it in the form it assumed by default, which was no real form at all. With lived in the center of a cloud of smoke, or darkness, or unrestrained night that would not part for the brightest lights. There was always the odor of hot blood around it, like fresh arterial spilled on the hot floor. And there was something in it of iron, and that Bel ad put into it. Her iron will, the indomitable emotion that kept her strong when the magic should have destroyed her. And it came through in the teeth and claws of her beast. It could strike with lightning speed and open its victims with fangs and fingers that would not yield for anything.</div><div>And yet there, before her chained dog, were six people who should not have been here. No one should have been here, let along some motley characters out of a morality play. The man with skin like bark and a crown of ravens, the woman with the skin of new spring and the force of the earth blazing through her eyes. A woman in ragged black, tossing a bowie knife in the air with one hand, her eyes focused on the beast the crouched atop a mound of bones, sticky flesh still clinging to them. Some rangy man with paint on his pants and a confused expression, a woman who looked as if she spent most of her time dusting books, and...another man.</div><div>There was nothing special about him. Black pants, black boots under them. Flame colored shirt and burgundy leather coat, hair like rust against dark iron, and eyes that burned like coals. He met her eyes and there was no fear in them, no anger. Just that slow, dull burn. And maybe...curiosity?</div><div>His eyebrow arched, then, and Bel felt her temper surge.</div><div>“Who the hell are you?”</div><div>Willow smiled, and stepped toward her. The beast tensed and something came from its throat that might have, had it come from an animal, been called a growl. He stopped moving, and spread his arms wide. Above him, the great crown sped up and began to cry in low, insistent voices.</div><div>“Bel, this isn't going to work. I'm sorry. But what you are doing is dangerous. It is going to hurt people. It already has. If you can still control the demon, then we can still reverse this. Please—“</div><div>“Stuff it, blowhard. You tried to kill me once, and you failed. So don't come to me telling me that you're only concerned for my welfare.” She sung her hand in a chopping motion. “I don't know how you got into my mind, but it hurt, and now you're going to leave, or I'm going to feed you to fido.”</div><div>Willow shook his head. “You won't do that. You aren't strong enough, and neither is it. Please, don't take this where you're aiming it. It will go badly for everyone.”</div><div>Bel shook her head, and in her dream she still had long, long hair. It waved and curled around her like mist as she took three sharp steps forward. The demon—not a demon. It's a construct, that's all, she reminded herself. The bastard was getting inside her head. The construct rose and began circling the group.</div><div>“It isn't going to go badly for me. I wanted to be safe, and now I finally will be. I won't have to worry about anything. If I need it, I can get it. Power.”</div><div>“I know that it can seem like that,” Willow said, still keeping his voice level, his hands extended, “but the truth is that when it has enough power to protect you, it will have enough will to decide that it doesn't want to anymore.”</div><div>“You stupid fr—“</div><div>“Hey, lady! Shut of for five minutes and stop interrupting my friend, okay? He's trying to save your ass, and my ass in the bargain, so I'm kind of an interested party, all right?”</div><div>Bel spun and glared. “Don't you tell me what to do, you red-winged blackbird. I'll nail you to a table and dissect you if you get in my way. And I've made sure I can, too.”</div><div>She slapped her hands together at chest height, and drew them slowly apart. Her brows were furrowed in concentration, and between her palm became slowly—ever so slowly—a wispy globe. As she continued to concentrate, it soon gained solidity, and there was even a hint of whatever material the sphere was composed of drifting from her palms. It slid down her fingertips and collected like raindrops in the hollow of her hand. This orb grew, and began to rotate gently about its vertical axis.</div><div>“What the hell is that, Willow?” Robin asked conversationally.</div><div>The man shrugged, gestured to the object Bel held. “She concentrating power into a physical manifestation. Nothing special, really. And fairly inefficient. Think about ghosts. They use up all kinds of every just to manifest on the physical plane, and what do they get? Ghost hunters. And the odd necrophile. The ones that really have any sense just use generalized feelings to get people out. This thing she's doing isn't going to have more effect than a moth's fart, regardless of where she dumps it.”</div><div>“Why's that, exactly?”</div><div>“Well, think about it like exchanging currency. Magic starts out incorporeal. Which means that it takes energy to change it into something physical. Then, when you want to change it back to actually do something with it, it takes more power to do that. Come to think of it, that sounds like human fat cells. Energy to put it up, and more energy to use it at all.”</div><div>Robin inspected the globe in Bel's hands. It had a faint golden glow, now, and continued to accelerate as he spoke. “And that's what she's doing? Making fat?”</div><div>“I was just trying to highlight how inefficient the process is.” Willow waved one bark-textured hand, dismissing Robin's interjection. ”Try not to take it too seriously.”</div><div>“Ahh. And she's going to...”</div><div>“Probably try to kill you with it, if I'm any judge at all. Or maybe she'll try to kill me. She's kind of erratic.”</div><div>And at this point, Bel brought her arms in, then threw them out again. The ball of energy didn't flow through the air, it didn't screech. It flew on wings of dream and thought and made to earth itself in Robin's immobile form.</div><div>Yet suddenly Robin was no longer a statue, watching the rest of the world move on by like the exhibit in a museum. His own hands were reaching out and as they bracketed the ball of urgently malevolent energy, it lost cohesion, and fell as a rain of acid on the bones at Robin's feet. In response to Bel's astonishment and mounting fury, shrugged, nonchalant.</div><div>“I've been dreaming lucid dreams since I was twelve. If that is the worst you can do, you are in for an ugly surprise.”</div><div>Bel didn't seem to accept this. “You can't do that. Nobody can do that to me. Not here, in my dream. Even he,” she pointed to Willow. “Can do that here.”</div><div>Robin shrugged again, and brushed an invisible speck off his coat. “I guess I'm just special. You know how it is.”</div><div>“Eurgh. Another arrogant prick. Get out. All of you.”</div><div>Willow shook his head. His hands, right and left, lifted to his sides. Behind him, the four other figures mimicked his gesture to the second.</div><div>“I didn't realize you taught synchronized dancing, black-bird man,” Bel sneered.</div><div>But he just smiled, and lifted his arms higher. And all around them, a wall appeared where once there had been no wall. It defined the distance in opalescent curves, and grew rapidly skyward. Bel spun and watched the pearly tones of the white wall rise up about her, penning her in. She snarled and barked a command to the construct, and it leapt into action, charging Willow himself. Another snapped command and he switched targets. The woman who looked just human seemed like a good choice. But Robin was shaking his head.</div><div>His arms were still at his sides, and he was watching Willow with a bemused look. But then he shifted his weight and his gaze and pinned her to the bones that were the earth in this place. He shook his head.</div><div>“I'm disappointed in you. Trying to hurt the weakest of us. Not that it will work, but still.” He turned away and turned again and he was between the construct and its target. On arm extended and there was an explosion of rushing air. The beast took no notice and landed on Robin with the full weight of its iron-and-fire body, and he screamed.</div><div>Annie screamed as the construct rolled off Robin and sank its fangs into her shoulder with scarcely a loss of momentum. She twisted in its grip, and the smell of blood intensified. Will dropped his arms and appeared at Annie's side. Across from him, Sarah had sunk both of her fists into the creature and was prying at its jaws. Willow joined her and together, they pried it open, only to have the creature turn on Willow, striking at him with its claws and screaming hate.</div><div>But Willow wasn't there anymore. Or rather, he just wasn't where the creature was. Like mist, wherever the claws swung, Willow flowed like water. Whether he moved so quickly Bel couldn't see, or he actually became insubstantial, she didn't know. But the beast didn't seem to care and turned to attack Sarah instead. She stepped backward and dropped into a springing roll that evaded the pounce, and she brought her arms up and into alignment with the painted man and the green woman. Willow joined them, and Annie, crying out on her knees, lifted her arms.</div><div>And Robin, from the ground where he laid, raised up his hands. Before they joined, Bel spat at him.</div><div>“What, no pithy last words?”</div><div>Robin tried to shrug from the ground, and replied. “Change the record baby, this one's done. Later, perhaps.” And he brought himself into alignment with the intruders in her domain. The wall curved over into a dome and they themselves began glowing internally with the same pearly light.</div><div>Robin was on his feet again, and his blood made ugly red smears across his glowing flesh. But he grinned and Bel found herself with the man directly in front of her. His hale arm grasped the front of her frayed coat and pulled her feet of the ground until her face was level with his. “Or how about this; are you in the game?”</div><div>He dropped her, and threw over his shoulder, “Because you don't have to play against me.”</div><div>She hit the ground, and they were gone. She was alone with her beast. And with a giant, opalescent wall that shimmered with lights that were not hers. She turned herself inward and tried to tough it with her arcane senses. Nothing at all. She was alone. And fenced in with her guard dog. And she wasn't safe.</div><div>When Bel woke, she drew and redrew her wards until morning.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Johnny Gray</div><div></div><div>Psychedelic spirals and</div><div>Gyroscopes of human bodies</div><div>Flashing lights and Red Racer</div><div>Dancing to the synth beat.</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Red Racer</div><div></div><div>The interior of Abu-Dee was dark and spacious, and the metal detector went off when Robin Redsson passed through it, like it always did. The afternoon sun behind him threw long shadows onto the floor of the club, outlining him in gray November light. Two PM, Abu-dee wasn’t open for business.</div><div>Quickly walking the length of the club, Robin jumped behind the bar and reset the alarm on the metal detector. He didn’t need help to let him know he was armed. Although from his talks with Willow, he’d gotten the impression that the man didn’t care much for Robin carrying a gun. Of course, Willow didn’t act like he’d ever need one, either. There weren’t many that would start a fight with a great tall man who was crazy enough to carry birds around on his shoulder, and he seemed to have enough friends that were okay with violence. The man didn’t need to fight; he had a legion.</div><div>Robin mixed himself a Fearless Flier, slid it down the bar, and jumped over the polished wood again. At the very end of the thirty-plus foot bar, Robin settled himself in on a stool—cracked red vinyl—and sighed deeply. The club felt cold, but it was November, and it always felt chill until the heat from a hundred or so bodies warmed things up. One foot resting on the barstool, drink in his hard, Robin felt comfortable. But he couldn’t actually relax sitting here. He still felt as tense as he’d been walking in the door. Taking his drink with him, Robin hiked up the steep stairway that led to the second floor loft.</div><div>The loft –only accessible through the club and the fire escape out back—overlooked the dance floor and most of the bar. When the amplifiers were going full blast directly beneath it, the overhang shook. Now though, all was quiet and silence. Too much silence. Leaving his drink on one of the three mismatched tables, Robin keyed his way into the apartment that the loft floor also sheltered and brought out his second best electric guitar. Throwing the strap around his neck, Robin returned to the table and played something quiet and thoughtful.</div><div>This wasn’t an afternoon for power chords, and Robin’s fingers found D minor more suited to his mood. Between the fingerpicking and the drink, he found himself relaxing. Magic of music, he thought.</div><div>As he played, he also started to feel like someone was watching him. Not the paranoid sense of being watched, but rather the odd notion that someone was enjoying his performance.</div><div>Robin paused to finish his drink, wiped his short beard on the red sleeve of his coat, then fell to playing again. This time, the sense of being watched was stronger, to the point where –still playing—Robin looked around several times for some hidden audience. When he was winding down but still drifting through the music, Robin heard a sound neither he nor his guitar had made.</div><div>Twisting suddenly, he saw a short figure in the shadows.</div><div>“Heard you playing. Got in through the fire escape.”</div><div>The figure seemed still but, as he watched, eased forward into the minimal lighting of the loft. White hair rose in a myriad of sharp, short spikes. Most were barely an inch in height; some shorter, some longer. Her eyes were dark. Robin could see where a near-constant glare had etched a line between her eyebrows. But she wasn’t glaring now. There were streaks of soot or something across her face, but—</div><div>“Yeah, I know how it looks. They won’t wash off. It’s char.”</div><div>The rest of her seemed hale enough. Not that he could see anything of her body, other than the fact that is must be scrawny, for such small clothes to hang loose on her. Her left hand was swathed in bandages, but Robin could see all five fingers move when she flexed her hands, so nothing too bad could have happened to them.</div><div>“What happened to you?”</div><div>“Struck by lightning.”</div><div>Robin raised his eyebrows. “Doesn’t that usually kill people?”</div><div>“I'm pretty rugged.”</div><div>“So it would seem.” Robin pulled a few more chords out of his guitar. “You said you heard me playing, but you didn’t say what you thought of it. Are you a fan, or a critic?”</div><div>“If I didn’t like what I was hearing, I wouldn’t have bothered to break in. Can I sit? It still hurts to stand up.”</div><div>Robin quickly laid his guitar on the table and stood, pulling a chair out.</div><div>“Go ahead and have a seat. You’re not bothering me any by being here. Maybe I can get you to listen to a song of mine that I’ve been trying to work out.”</div><div>Bel huffed a laugh, then pressed one bandaged hand to her ribs. Tightly, she said “I don’t know much about music, just what I like, and what I don’t. So I don’t think I’ll be much help to you there. But I’ll still listen.”</div><div>She moved slowly, her  feet shuffling across the floor, as she tried to bend her legs as little as possible. Sitting in the chair, she took the arm Robin held out for support and lowered herself into the seat.</div><div>“Thanks, I guess. I’ve been moving better, but still not as well as I used to.”</div><div>Robin took his seat back and leaned into it to recover his guitar from the table. “This piece has kind of a call-and-response sound to it. Willow was good enough to help me out with some of the rhythm a while ago, maybe you could do the same?”</div><div>Bel stiffened and pushed herself erect, holding the back of the chair for support. “You're one of Willow's little playmates?”</div><div>“Well, I've never really been one to work or play well with others, but Willow acts like a nice enough sort. Why? Do you have some sort of problem with him?”</div><div>“He's the one that struck me with lightning.”</div><div>“Last time I heard,” Robin leaned forward with one hand muting the strings, “It's awfully hard for a person to pull out a bolt from a blue sky.”</div><div>“He's not a person. Not like we are, anyway. And the sky was cloudy, but it hadn't been before. Only, when I talked to the pack, they thought it had been cloudy all night. But I remember the sunset, like a great bloody eye on the horizon.” Bel took her head in her hands, running the taped white gauze through her hair. “It doesn't make any sense, and then Jessica tried to take me while I was still hurt.”</div><div>Taken aback, Robin hid his surprise while nodding sagely. “Hence the broken ribs, when a lightning strike wouldn't have done anything like that.”</div><div>“Right,” Bel's voice had an ugly tone of satisfaction to it.</div><div>“But I take it that I should see the other guy?”</div><div>“You could say that. If you could see her under the casts and white linen, I doubt there's anything you'd like looking at.”</div><div>Robin pulled a face. “Lovely.”</div><div>“What? You think I would have gotten anything better if I'd have let her walk all over me? I fought, and I still got these damn broken ribs and an elbow that won't move right.”</div><div>“I guess. I just try to avoid that kind of thing. Which is why I manage a club now, I guess.” Robin felt the weight of the Glock under his arm as he shrugged. “It beats broken ribs and dislocated elbows.”</div><div>Bel shrugged gingerly with her right shoulder. The other, braced against the chair back, was shaking. “The hell to you know?”</div><div>“Hey, I know plenty,” this is stupid, Robin thought. And set his guitar aside again. The strings wailed as he pulled his hand away from them. Then he pulled up his coat shirt and undershirt, exposing a line down his side of four irregularly shaped bumps, one per rib.</div><div>“Those could be from falling down the stairs.”</div><div>“You know, that's just what my father said when he took me to the ER for them, right after he broke them. Doesn't matter.” He dropped his shirt, see, old son? Something in the back of his mind muttered at him. Damn stupid. Robin shook his head. “God, just sit down before you fall down. It's the right elbow that's still screwed up?”</div><div>He waited until Bel had both sat and nodded.</div><div>“Then slide up that sleeve and I'll see what I can do about it.”</div><div>Instant distrust, and a calculating look at the exit.</div><div>“Look, I've had plenty of experience patching myself up,” he looked at Bel out of the corner of his eye. “Whether it was because I fell down the stairs, or... not.”</div><div>She clenched her jaw. Robin could see the muscle flexing as she chewed her words before speaking. “I don't know how to fix this. Never had an elbow quite so...” She trailed off.</div><div>“Quite so full of blazing red-hot wires whenever you touch it? Yeah, that's just about right for a dislocated elbow. Come on, I'll pop it back into place, and then get back to the music.”</div><div>“Just like that?”</div><div>“Just like that.” He smiled ruefully, “and if anyone asks, I promise I'll say you threatened my life like a good little soldier of darkness.”</div><div>“Soldier of darkness. I like that. It fits.”</div><div>Robin knelt by Bel's side and took hold of her arm above and below the elbow. “Now,” he said, getting a good grip on her pale, pale skin, “this is going to hurt. A lot.”</div><div>She shrugged. “I walked away from being hit by lightning a few weeks ago. This is going to hurt by comparison?”</div><div>“Fair enough. Are you ready?”</div><div>A jerk, the grunch sound of popping cartilage, and a scream. Bel held her arm close, grinding her teeth and flexing her elbow. “It works again.”</div><div>“Yeah, but you should probably keep it in a sling for a few days, so it doesn't get all fucked up again.”</div><div>“A sling? That kind of weakness would have the whole pack challenging me for power. And like you said, I don't want my elbow broken this time. I'll just tuck it into the coat.”</div><div>Robin nodded, and took hold of the lapel of Bel's coat. “Here, I'll just--”</div><div>And then everything went away for a while. The fairies came out to dance, and Robin, rather than dancing with them, just laid on the floor until he woke up again. Then he passed some time wondering if his jaw was broken, and if he dared to feel it to find out. Ultimately deciding that some things have to be known, Robin inched his hand toward his face, only to be interrupted by a sheet of paper.</div><div>Intensely happy at something to keep his hand away from his jaw, Robin spent five minutes trying to get both eyes to focus at once before giving up and closing his left eye. That was much easier.</div><div>Robin.</div><div>    Personal space issues. Can't believe I let you touch my arm. Hope you're not too mad.</div><div>Bel</div><div>oh, and I liked your music.</div><div>-b</div><div></div><div>Hmm, Robin thought. She's not nearly as bad as she sounded. Hmmmmm. Then he touched his jaw and though that she might be every bit as bad as Kimberly had described.</div><div></div><div>By eleven PM when the doors opened, it was snowing, and Robin Redsson was back on his feet. All painkillers being equal, after rather a lot of them and the liberal application of an ice pack, Robin was feeling almost human again. He did have a bruise that covered almost half of his face, but there were worse things. Like the music which most nights did not bother him, but today was making his teeth vibrate their way out of his skull. He was almost ready to plead fatigue and leave the bar tending to Shannon when Kimberly showed up with Willow in tow.</div><div>“I offer to take her to lands unexplored by man since the Dawn Times, to places that human feet have not tread for an age, to see wonders undreamed-of by these paltry remains of the human race—no offense Robin—and what does she want to do? Dance. Honestly, I'm actually thinking about getting a disco ball installed in my living room for her.”</div><div>“Hi Willow. Tea?”</div><div>“Please. And a bowl of it for my friends, too?”</div><div>“No problem. And something blue and sweet for the lady?”</div><div>Kimberly smiled and nodded, saying “I'd love it.” Then she turned to Willow. “Some nights I feel like exploring the unknown, and some nights I feel like staying in, an some nights I feel like dancing. Tonight is a dancing night.”</div><div>“I know. But still, there are times I feel like you aren't in the proper spirit of the intrepid adventurer as you should be.”</div><div>Kimberly shrugged. “I'm not an intrepid adventurer, I'm an English major with a minor in art. Not so much with the adventure.”</div><div>“Well, there is that. You do know that I don't hold it against you, right?”</div><div>“I know.” Kimberly shrugged off her coat and laid it over a barstool. “But you could do something to moderate those dramatic urges.”</div><div>Willow shrugged and let Huginn and Muninn climb down his arms to the bar, where their saucer of tea was waiting. “I don't know at all what you mean. Drama? Me? And anyway, you seemed quite calm about the adventure you had in my home.”</div><div>Kimberly shrugged while the club around her pulsed with light and sound. “I don't really see that as an adventure as practical experience for dealing with home invasion.”</div><div>“Bah,” Willow threw his hands into the air. “You just have no sense of the epic spirit. I don't know why I bother.”</div><div>Robin presently returned with Kimberly's sweet blue drink. Laying it on the bar before her, he turned to Willow with a contemplative look. “Hey, I met someone today. You might be interested to hear about it, and I had some questions that you might be able to answer. Are you able to get away any time soon?”</div><div>Both Willow and Robin looked to Kimberly as Robin spoke. She nodded her acquiescence and sipped her drink. “I'm not heading home without you Willow. I'll finish my drink, and I'll be here. Or on the dance floor. Or somewhere else. Around.”</div><div>“Then I will be back directly,” Willow said as he collected Huginn and Muninn.</div><div>Quickly walking the length of the bar, Robin led Willow up the stairs to the loft and into his apartment. When he shut the metal door behind them, Robin sighed in relief as the pounding music lessened somewhat. The inside of the door was the same gray painted metal as the outside, and the dents, chips, and scores across the interior were worse, if anything, than those on the exterior. Over what looked to be some of the worse abrasions, Robin had hung a poster showing several dozen common guitar chords. The rest of the room showed less neglect than the entryway might have led onlookers to believe, and while the floor was littered with amplifiers and instruments, it was clean and free of other debris.</div><div>Across the room from the door, which was centered in the wall, a tattered second hand couch was slumped against the wall. Willow deftly avoided the instruments on the floor as he made his way to the couch. Sitting down, he gestured at the cluttered room.</div><div>“I like what you've done with the place.”</div><div>“You mean the fact that now I have those shelves I've been talking about building for months? Yeah, I got around to it a couple of weeks ago.” The shelves in question were raw wood, unvarnished and unpainted, that stood against the same wall as the door, wrapping around the corners on both sides of the room. On the left, the shelves stopped where the couch abutted the wall, and on the right they turned another corner and stopped at the doorway to the kitchen.</div><div>“Indeed. Now,” Willow's face clouded. “What was it you wanted to talk to me about in private?”</div><div>Robin took a deep breath. “I...met Bel –that woman you told me about—today.”</div><div>The ravens on Willow's shoulders ruffled their feathers and moved restlessly. Willow ran a soothing hand down their backs to calm them before speaking. “You met her? Under what circumstances?”</div><div>“That's what was odd. She wasn't at all hostile, at least not in the way you described her. She said she came in to listen to the music –I was playing by myself, nothing special.” and in that fashion, sometimes halting, Robin outlined what had happened during Bel's visit. And to his surprise, Willow nodded sympathetically when he mentioned the injuries she had suffered, both from the lightning and from other, less empyrean sources.</div><div>“She is quite an extraordinary young woman. I just wish she was less driven by the pursuit of power. She'll get it, but I don't want anything untoward to happen to her when she does.”</div><div>“Do you know something?”</div><div>“About her? Yes. What do you want to know?”</div><div>Robin shrugged suddenly, looked aside. “I'm not sure. She seemed prickly, but not dangerous like when she attacked Kimberly. Not like when you...”</div><div>“...hit her with lightning? I'm not sure I can tell you happened. It could be that being hurt like that gave her some perspective. Or it could be that she is lying through her teeth for some other reason. I honestly don't know.” Willow shook his head, and Huginn and Muninn started croaking and flapping their wings again until he quieted them. “I do know this much; whatever Bel's new stance, something had been working with very dark powers lately. Darker than I like to touch.”</div><div>Robin's eyes narrowed. “What does that mean, 'darker than you like to touch'? I thought you told me there was no such thing as black magic.”</div><div>“Oh, sure. There is no such thing as pure evil, and probably no such thing as pure good in magic either—though I hold out hope. But that doesn't mean that everything that magic deals with is sunshine and kittens. Remember animals eating their own young to survive. Remember flesh-eating bacteria and beech trees dripping poison on the ground so that nothing but beech tress can grow. Think about water-horses drowning the young and beautiful because of their sweet struggles. Think about things in the unseelie court and cruelty for the fun of it.</div><div>“No, Robin. Magic is nature and nature is neither evil nor good. I don't believe in evil. But what's been brewing in Swett Street? I know it's not good. Those rituals cannot be used for right.”</div><div>“How do you know that?”</div><div>Willow sighed and stared into the distance, eyes far from the club. They took on a deeper shine than Robin had previously seen, and the strange man slipped his hands into his pockets.</div><div>“I wrote some of them,” he said.</div><div></div><div>It was night-upon-dawn when Robin had another chance to relax. He found himself back on the loft, coaxing tunes out of his guitar while he leaned back in a much-abused armless chair. I wrote some of them, Willow was still saying in his mind. Remember flesh-eating bacteria. Robin wasn't sure all of those things qualified as evil. Pointless destruction, maybe, but evil? His fingers worked the guitar's strings while he worried at the problem.</div><div>He knew what had happened to Kimberly, that Bel had threatened her life. But... That hadn't been the woman he'd met. Maybe being hit by lightning had affected her point of view? He had more questions than answers, but he knew where to get answers. Or at least, more information. He just had to find out which apartment was hers. Somewhere on Swett Street. It shouldn't be hard. And he knew what kind of questions to ask.</div><div>The music coming from his guitar changed as he made his decision, coming harder and faster. The open chords gave it a raw sound as he planned his approach, and then a voice popped up out from where no voice could be and blew all his plans away like so many cobwebs.</div><div>“Play that last measure again.”</div><div>“Bel?” Robin sat up, chair legs thumping to the floor.</div><div>“Just...play it again,” and there was an anguished note in her voice. Something about the painful whisper that made Robin quiver in response. She wanted him to play it again.</div><div>So he did. And she sang.</div><div>“I want to feel the burn</div><div>of your lips on mine</div><div>hands pulling me tight</div><div></div><div>And I want to know</div><div>that you'll be mine, mine mine</div><div>once tonight is over.</div><div></div><div>If I can feel this again</div><div>you pinned between me and the wall</div><div>take what you want</div><div></div><div>take blood bone and hair</div><div>everything that I am</div><div>if you'll be mine, I'm yours.”</div><div>Carefully, carefully, Robin pulled the bar to its close. D minor, A seventh,G seventh, and then he muted the strings with the palm of his hand. The silence that followed had texture, had a life all its own. It looped around Robin and he felt its velvety surface glide across his face, whisper in his ear of balances made and broken, of rising darkness, of magic that looked to be the color of blood in his mind's eye. And while he felt it, and sifted through the layers of silence that wrapped the loft floor, Robin was aware of being studied. The yellow sodium-light coming from the lamp outside cast a harsh glow on his face, in his eyes. He was blind to everything that lay in darkness, which, with all the bar-lights shut off, was most of the floor. Somewhere in those shadows, he knew Bel was standing. Was she still hurt; had she come to do more damage to him than she had before?</div><div>Robin swallowed, coughed. “I didn't know you were a poet.”</div><div>“I'm not.”</div><div>“Then what was that?”</div><div>There came the sound of a shrug; cloth sliding on cloth and the jingling of metal. “I don't know. You were playing and that fit.”</div><div>It fit in more ways than one. What are you trying to tell me, woman?</div><div>“It did. Although I think the first two stanzas need some work. No offense.”</div><div>“Those two and the last two, yeah.”</div><div>Robin laughed and slipped the guitar strap over his head. When he laid the  instrument on the table beside him, Bel's voice slipped out of the dark.</div><div>“If you're friends with Willow, you probably shouldn't know me.”</div><div>“What?” Robin levered himself, stiff legs and all, out of the chair. “Why not?”</div><div>The sound of a shrug came again, and as he stepped out of the light Bel was almost visible in the corner.</div><div>“It's just...Willow and I are coming toward something that isn't pretty. I wouldn't want to get caught in the middle. Especially if getting caught in the middle has both Willow and me coming for you.”</div><div>“Willow doesn't seem like the type to hurt anyone. And you didn't intend to hit me, so it's not like I can hold that against you.” Robin took a step toward Bel. “What are you going to do; kill me for being Willow's friend?”</div><div>“Don't laugh. It might happen. Some of those spells we've built have teeth.”</div><div>Robin raised an eyebrow. “Are you trying to do magic to hurt people?”</div><div>“Not hurt.” Bel stepped a little closer to Robin, just outside of arm's length. “Just...trying to make us safe. We don't want anyone trying to hurt us.”</div><div>Wiping his palms across the backs of his jeans, Robin struggled for the right words. “But, if you hurt people before they do anything, then it isn't really defense.”</div><div>“Hey, you don't know!” Bel shuffled away, her hands rising in what could have been a warding motion, if they hadn't been so stiff and rigid.</div><div>“I'm sorry. Peace?” Robin raised his own hands, spreading them wide. “Here, come have a seat. The chairs in my apartment are better than this, if you want to go in there. It's just through this door.”</div><div>“Okay,” Bel entered somewhat hesitantly, as if she expected Robin to attack her at any moment. For his part, Robin tried to keep a good distance from her. If nothing else, that would keep her from decking him again. When Bel had settled herself in Robin's favorite red armchair, he turned on a low-wattage bulb that he used while he was trying to compose. It gave just enough light to see by, and not enough to really illuminate the room and make all its distracting features jump out.</div><div>“So...” Robin began as he took a seat on the couch facing Bel. “If your magic is intended to be defensive, what are you defending against?”</div><div>“Well, do you know anything about the Quabbalah?”</div><div>Robin shrugged. “Just what every sophomore in philosophy picks up in his spare time. Ten Sephira corresponding to planets, except for the tenth, which is supposed to be enlightenment or something. Each Sephira has a lot of symbolic meanings, like mercury is quickness of thought and so on. Doesn't it have some connection with Ceremonial magic –angels and devils and all that jazz?”</div><div>“You're pretty much right. But there are things that the Ceremonials didn't talk about. Demons and dark spirits and all sorts of ugly things just waiting to jump out of the abyss and into your soul. Those are the things that we're trying to fight. The pack and I.”</div><div>“The pack?”</div><div>“They're my coven. More or less. We all live in the area, and we all know what's going on. It feels like we're being drowned in despair. Haven't you ever walked through Swett street? You'd know what I mean if you had.”</div><div>Robin shook his head. “I do know what you mean. Why don't you just move, why go through all the stuff you're doing dark rituals like Willow said?”</div><div>“Because once it's found you, whatever it is, you're stuck with it. The damned things won't leave you alone, they won't give you rest. It's just darkness and death and despair until you just give in and either do what it wants, or kill yourself. And it amounts to the same thing, either way.”</div><div>“I've heard that you're supposed to get out of magic what you put into it. Where did all this dark magic crap come from to begin with?”</div><div>“I don't know. But I do know that I can keep it away, and I'm going to.”</div><div>“How?”</div><div>“By fighting fire with fire. There are a bunch of shitsucking little demon bastards swarming around us. But the pack and I are going to dig up one motherfucker of a demon and bind him. Out personal watchdog.”</div><div>“That sounds like a really bad idea.”</div><div>Bel shook her head. “It's the only thing we can do. Anything else we try to throw at these creeps, it just makes them stronger. This way will work, I'm sure. 'Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for I am the meanest sunnuva bitch in the whole valley,' right?”</div><div>“I've heard that one before. How about 'do not call up that which you cannot put back down'?”</div><div>“Old quotations don't make things better, Robin. It doesn't matter, anyway. We've started already. Before the year is out, we'll have our guard dog. Just you wait and see.”</div><div>“I guess I'll have to. Maybe Willow could help you out instead? It really seems like he has a piece of something good.”</div><div>“He does. But he doesn't want to share it. So fuck 'im. We'll do it my way, and we'll win. At least this way, we don't have to share with some half-fay ornithologist.”</div><div>Robin opened his mouth to retort, thought better of it. Willow could stand up for himself, and if Robin started pushing at Bel, she might not come back at all. From the way she was acting, coming into his club was stretching it, and making it into his front room was a near-miracle. He didn't want Bel to cut and run. He liked her, no matter how dark the powers she was fooling with.</div><div>“I guess I'll just let myself out.” Bel was looking at the floor. Tension was twanging across her shoulders, but the expression she wore-insofar as Robin could read-was something like sadness.</div><div>“No, I'll show you out. It's almost dawn. You should get some sleep.”</div><div>“Right,” Bel nodded, “right. And, um.”</div><div>“ 'And um' what?”</div><div>“If you want to help me work on those lyrics, just say the word, okay? I'm going to have a lot of free time once we've got out guard dog.”</div><div>Not really sure how to take that, Robin nodded, and followed Bel out to the landing and, when she made for the fire escape, said “You know, I can just let you out the front door. It might be easier on you.”</div><div>“Bull. I'll take the pain. I've had worse.”</div><div>And that was Bel.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Corvus Clan</div><div></div><div>At night when the moon is dark,</div><div>I listen to the eldritch chants from the stars,</div><div>While Fairie bands play counterpoint.</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Feel the Earth</div><div></div><div>Kimberly sat in her overstuffed chair as night began to fall on Maplebrook. The coffee house in which she sat was only dimly lit, keeping the dusk at bay. The woman’s name was Rose, though Kimberly didn’t know it. She was holding a key tightly, its shank rising from her fingers like a tiny bronze colored obelisk. A half-empty cup of cocoa cooled on the low table beside her. Kimberly worked at her pad, pencil sketching Rose and her environs into the picture. Illumination from the pierced-iron sconces on the wall glazed the scene in honey, preserved in Kimberly’s sketchbook. Half-finished, it radiated the vitality of a ruddy copper statue fresh from the mold. Kim mused silently, wondering whom this woman was. And why is she so intent? It’s just a key. But her subject remained silent, her eyes faithfully traveled the key’s length and back. Kimberly stared too. Mountains and valleys in miniature made paths in her mind, then her paper. Bronzed geography whispered its history, told the future in locks’ Delphic caves.</div><div>From her own chair, Rose’s mind was simmering with thoughts of having a home. Finally, she had a home. A burst of laughter from the back of the room made her jump and drop the key. The sound of it ringing on the wood brought her back to reality sharply and, scooping the bronzed piece up, she checked the clock. It was gone eleven. Looking suspiciously out the windows, she hurriedly pulled on her parka and paused to gulp down the clotted chocolate. Sliding it back onto the table, Rose stood and headed for the door. Looking into her eyes, Kimberly saw prosaic things as the woman hauled on the door handle, which shuddered and jerked in her grasp. The lone bell wired to it stopped her, and the cold billowed in while she watched it jingle itself to stillness. Then she smiled a little and went out into the wind.</div><div>Kimberly hurriedly stuffed her open pad into an acrylic portfolio and pulled her things together, dodging tables and heading toward the door. Outside, the gusts swirling about her hauled at the scarf she wore and the portfolio became a plastic sail. Few and far between, the streetlight lent an unhealthy attitude to the snow-banks. In a pool of sulfurous yellow light, Kimberly saw her subject on her hands and knees, scrabbling madly for something on the ground at her feet.</div><div>Hurrying to catch up, Kimberly encountered one of the town’s most distinguishing characteristics. Maple Brook was famous for its potholes. New residents could be identified in the winter by their dripping boots. Grimacing, Kimberly extracted her foot from an ice-skimmed pothole full of icy water. She squeezed some of the water from her pant-leg, and resumed her approach.</div><div> “Excuse me, are you all right?” Kimberly squatted. “I’m an artist. I did a sketch of you at the café, and I was wondering if you wanted it.”</div><div>“I lost it.” The other woman’s hands didn’t stop scuffling with the ground, water-drenched hands and coat covered with white crystals.</div><div>“What did you loose? Can I help?” Kim weighted down the pad with her bag, and dropped to her knees, pausing to mark the sweep of wings overhead. Raven, if she heard correctly.</div><div> “My key, it’s -what, what did you say?”</div><div>“I offered to help you. And I asked if you wanted this.” She pulled out her sketch and held it up for inspection.</div><div>“It’s beautiful but,” she shook her head slowly, “I really can’t pay for it.”</div><div>“That’s good, because I’m not trying to sell it to you. This is just practice, otherwise I would have asked permission to draw you.”</div><div>“My name is Rose. I’d love to have your drawing but unless I find that key, I won’t have anywhere to hang it.” She pulled one of her hands out of the pool and offered it to Kimberly, who took it and stood.</div><div>“Your fingers are like ice. We should go back to the café for a while.”</div><div>“No, no, I’m sure that I dropped my key near here. It’s got to be here.”</div><div>Kim knelt back down and, rolling up her coat sleeves, shrugged. This was better than digging through a dissection for her Bio distribution, at least. The wind suddenly redoubled its efforts to turn them into human kites, snapping Rose’s hair out like a strawberry pennant. Kimberly dredged the pool with her fingers, feeling nothing beneath her rapidly-numbing digits but Rose’s hands. It did not take her long to decide that the pothole was empty of keys. There was lots of very cold water, and Kimberly was not a fan of water this cold.</div><div>“There’s no way we can do this now. We’ll get frostbite, and I’m attached to my fingers.” She wiped her hands on her jeans, wincing at the suddenly ice-like patches of skin under her wet pants. Kim picked up her portfolio, and tugged Rose along the sidewalk, stumbling against the wind. As they walked, Kimberly combed the ground with her eye, searching for glints of bronze.</div><div>When they reached the café, Kimberly walked up to the counter.</div><div>“Excuse me,” she said to the cashier.</div><div>He ignored her, scribbling away in a little notebook. She reached over and grabbed him by the collar. “I’m sure your poetry is very important, but I said excuse me. Have you seen a little bronze key, about so long?” Her fingers measured an inch and a half.</div><div>“Nah. Haven’t swept up yet.” He shrugged.</div><div>“Thanks.” She bit off the word and strode over to Rose. “Found it?”</div><div>“No. It’s not here. I checked in the cushions, too.” They spent a few minutes asking around, but no one had seen the key.</div><div>Firmly wedged into overstuffed chairs, Kimberly and Rose faced each other, clutching mugs of cocoa. The nylon winter gear hung over the radiator, steaming from the heat. In wordless charity with each other, the women sat and let the café warm them from the outside while the cocoa threaded through their cold bodies.</div><div>“What’s it open?” Kimberly took a gulp of her cocoa.</div><div>Rose smiled, “My apartment. I just made the security deposit. It’s got a bed and a stove and not much else.” She squeezed more tightly into her chair. “It’s on Water Street.</div><div>Kim spoke through her chocolate mustache, “You got an apartment on Water Street? Do you know how dangerous it is there?”</div><div>“Umm, yes. But I needed the apartment. It was the only one I could afford. And the building’s great. It’s really old, and everything looks really interesting. All the old forced-air vents are still there, and a lot of the fixtures are antique.” She poked her boots closer to the radiator. “The window looks out into an undeveloped lot, and it’s full of little trees. I don’t think they can get very big, but they’re still beautiful.”</div><div>“And that was the only key you had?”</div><div>“Yes. The landlord wouldn’t give me another one.” Rose started gnawing on a fingernail. “He said ‘it doesn’t do to give tenants too many’ whatever that means.”</div><div>Kim snorted. “Well, when we find it, I’ll introduce you to a good local hardware store, and damn the landlord’s objections.” She drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair. “In the meantime, have you got a place to spend the night? There’s room in my dorm, and the R.A. never makes anyone sign in.”</div><div>“You remind me of my sis… Someone I used to know; someone very strong.” Rose shook her head. “And that's nice of you, but I don’t know. I don’t know if we’ll find the key. The landlord is never home, anyway, so I'll never get another one.” Her hands shook a little as she put down her cup.</div><div>“What's wrong?” Kimberly leaned forward and took one of Rose’s hands. “Are you all right?”</div><div>“No. I finally got my own place and it’s gone. There’s no way I’ll find the key. Even if I do, then so what? I’ll probably get fired or something and lose my apartment.”</div><div>Kim’s brow furrowed. “Hey, calm down. That won't happen.”</div><div>“Yes it will. That sort of thing always happens to me. Nothing good ever falls into my lap. And now I live right next to Sweat Street, and I have to deal with that woman and her thugs -if I do get to stay there, that is.” Rose picked at the seat with her free hand.</div><div>“Hey, there’s no way everything that chances into your life is bad. But come on, our shoes are dry. Let’s go for a walk. The trees in Sokonis park should break up the wind.”</div><div>Outside, when Rose bent to scrabble through the blowing snow, Kimberly pulled her back upright. “There's no way we’re going to find it in this, if we didn’t earlier.” They darted across the street, pushing through the slush and skipping the quarter-mile slog to a crosswalk.</div><div>The part wasn’t very far away, though the biting wind made it seem a long trip. Beneath the evergreens that comprised most of the Park’s land, the wind faded to a whisper. Out of the sheeting billows, Kimberly paused to look at the night, and point out interesting things to Rose. That hummock in the snow was a flower bed. Those trees had the brightest white flowers for miles around. Off that way was the stream, all covered over with ice.</div><div>The evergreens blotted out most of the sky, but a break in the tight canopy and clouds above it let the moon shine down. Gibbous going to new, there was still enough light left over to see the texture of the bark on the trees. Their crazed patterns were etched in bright silver and grainy gray.</div><div>“Is that a bird?” Rose pointed.</div><div>Overhead, a raven flapped its wings and cawed. It stood on a wolf pine’s lonely branch.</div><div>Kimberly paused, following the out flung finger. She smiled. “Oh, yes. I know him. His family, certainly.”</div><div>“What is it? It’s huge.” She slowly lowered her arm.</div><div>“It’s a raven. Corvus Corax.” Kimberly dug into her pocket for the Ziploc bag of old steak, which she carried just for these occasions. “I’ve always liked them -not just ravens- and they all seem to like me. A crow is Corvus Brachyrhyncos.”</div><div>“I like those names. Don’t they usually live in large families?”</div><div>Shaking out some of the cut-up left-overs, Kimberly said, “Not most ravens, but crows do. So do rooks -Corvus Frugelius.” Ha, listen to me: I'm starting to sound like Willow.</div><div>“I must be like a raven then. If you got my family together, we’d kill each other. Can I throw some for him too?”</div><div>Kim passed over a small handful and tucked away the bag. “So you’ve got a big family -with all those fun feuds?” The raven leaped out of the tree, fluttering down to the ground.</div><div>“Nope. One sister, one brother, two parents. We just can’t stand each other. Well, we all loved my sister.” She tossed some of the meat towards the bird and dragged the back of her hand across her eyes.</div><div>“Was she the baby?”</div><div>“No. Five years older than me. She disappeared when I was eleven.”</div><div>“Oh.” Kimberly bit her tongue. Damn. I had to pry, didn’t I?</div><div>“It's not a big deal. I’m used to it.”</div><div>The raven cocked his head intently. As the silence between the women stretched out, he pecked at the meat, then gobbled down one chunk. Then, after what seemed a moment’s consideration, it took another: ravens are never content with just one. The wind whistled overhead and, as Kim started speaking, the bird shrieked. Leaping into labored flight, the raven retreated to an enormous wolf pine and glared out at the clearing.</div><div>Rose took a step back. “What was that about?”</div><div>“I don’t know. Usually they don’t act like extras for The Birds.” Kimberly put her back against a tree. “You might want to join me. No one can come up behind you that way.”</div><div>As Rose obeyed, a figure came out of the evergreens across the clearing. It stepped into the moonlight with a razor smile and a chiming chorus of chains. She was at least as tall as either Kimberly or Rose, and vaguely resembled a rather underweight skeleton. The sound her movement caused was the rattling of chains and padlocks. They draped her figure and were a bright, chromed silver. Her fingers were covered in rings or silver claws, and one thumb had an enormous onyx set over the nail. Her boots were out-sized, probably half again as big as they should have been and knocking about loose.</div><div>Rose whispered, as the apparition strode toward them, “That’s Jess. She’s one of that woman's gang.”</div><div>Kim nodded, because it seemed to be expected, and sized up the figure. “I know them. Not this one, though. I can deal with her.”</div><div>“We could…Leave, right?”</div><div>Kimberly shook her head, made eye contact with Jess. “What are you, Marley’s under-study?”</div><div>“What?”</div><div>“Never mind. What do you want?” Kimberly kept her back to the tree.</div><div>“I wanted to talk to Rose. She and I have some business.” Jess walked into the shadow of the trees sheltering Rose and Kimberly. “The offer still stands, Rose. But it won’t be there forever.”</div><div>Rose dug into her pockets. “I’d rather not talk with you. I’m busy.” She tossed a chunk of steak across the clearing. The raven screamed again, and answering calls came from the woods around them. The sweep of wings came over the wind as black birds began settling on the wolf pine. Chains rattling, Jess looked around quickly. She didn’t seem to see the birds filling the tree. Her hands came out of her coat holding twin knives.</div><div>“What’s making that damn noise?”</div><div>Kimberly stared at the tree, heavy with black bodies. It seethed in the moonlight, which was fading fast. There was a sound from under the tree. Flapping wings.</div><div>Kimberly smiled, a dark grin the moonlight’s chiaroscuro. “You have bad night vision, don’t you Jess?”</div><div>“Yeah, what’s your point?”</div><div>“Her point is, Jessica, that I’m over here, and feeling rather left out,” said Willow Gray, from underneath the wolf pine. Kimberly twisted sharply and saw Willow leaning calmly in moon-dimmed lines against the shadowed trunk. There were no footprints around him in the snow.</div><div>Jess’ reaction was immediate. Her knives disappeared almost as quickly as they’d come out, and she took several steps back across the clearing, boots scraping across the snowy ground. In the middle of the clearing, she seemed to remember herself, and stopped.</div><div>“What do I care, if you’re here?” she said, gruffly.</div><div>His coat black under the moon, Willow stepped into the clearing, keeping his eyes levelly fixed on Jess. He had a raven perched, large and looming, on each of his shoulders. In his hand was a staff, tied all over with green and russet tassels.</div><div>“Well, what do you care?” he asked softly, “I don’t know, I’m sure.”</div><div>Jess shook her head in disgust. “I… You can’t have this one. Not from on our doorstep. It would be war.”</div><div>“Now, Jessica. You know and I know, those aren't words you came up with on your own. If you're going to speak, I want to hear your words.” Above Willow, the birds screamed again, and subsided before him. “I’m sure you have plenty of things you would like to say, so please, do so. I am not interested in hearing you parrot another’s thoughts when you have so many of your very own.”</div><div>Jess stopped short, shook her head. “I haven’t got time for this crap.” She turned and trudged away, into the woods again.</div><div>Willow watched her until she passed out of sight. When the sound of her stomping and cursing were no longer audible, and the chiming of her chains had faded into the wind, he turned to Kimberly and Rose. His coat swept the snow as he walked to them, and one of the ravens gave a cry.</div><div>As he came closer, details began to jump out, set off by the incisive moonlight. His staff, seven feet tall and hung with tassels, became a broken-off pine branch, and his coat receded from an ominous black shadow to a worn-about-the-edges green trench coat. The two ravens remained, however, ravens.</div><div>Willow passed Kimberly his ‘staff’ and reached back to let one of the ravens step onto his hand. He turned to Rose. “This is Huginn,” he said, setting the bird on her shoulder. “He broke his wing several years ago, and it healed badly. He’s been living with me for quite a while now.”</div><div>He picked up the other bird, set it on Rose’s free shoulder. “This is Muninn. I found him two years ago, fallen out of his nest. He can fly, but never got the hang of getting his own food. My name is Willow Gray. How do you do?” He held out his hand.</div><div>Rose shook it gingerly, trying not to jostle the two birds on her shoulders. “Um, thank you for scaring Jess off. Are you sure they should stay on my shoulders? I don’t want them to slide off.”</div><div>Kimberly snorted, but Willow replied with a smile. “No, they’re quite used to unstable perches, my friends in the Corvus Clan. When I get up first thing in the morning, I have a tendency to fall asleep whenever I sit down.”</div><div>“You’ve only fallen into your cereal twice that I’ve seen,” Kimberly noted.</div><div>“That’s because I get up before noon most days, unlike some people,” he said, taking his impromptu staff from Kim and pitching it into the woods. “I'm going to get something to drink. I've been out here for several hours, and I'm starting to get cold. Rose, Kimberly, would you like to join me?</div><div>Rose nodded. “That would be nice. What did you mean, ‘my friends in the Corvus Clan’?”</div><div>Willow cocked his head to the side. “Oh, they're my inside men, you see. Ravens are so taciturn you usually can't get a word out of them. Huginn and Muninn are experts at that, and they're my best friends.” He laughed, and pulled her and Kimberly along.</div><div>“This way, I know a place you might like.”</div><div></div><div>Inside Abu-dee, people danced. It was a nightclub, so that was to be expected. Willow got them seats at the bar by asking nicely. They talked quietly for a while, somehow able to hear each other quite clearly despite the loudness of the Techno music. Kimberly drank something that came in small glasses and was rather sweet. It was bright blue, and also came with an umbrella. Willow only had tea, as did Huginn. Rose had another cup of cocoa, and was letting it get cold while she talked with Willow. Muninn was perched above the disco ball on the dance floor.</div><div>“So Bel and her hoodlums are giving you trouble?” Willow steepled his fingers over the tea, which sat steeping on the bar.</div><div>“Sort of. They've been lounging around and threatening. They haven't done anything, but...” Rose shrugged and sipped her cocoa. She grimaced at the temperature.</div><div>Willow took it from her and flagged down the bartender for another. “What have you done about them?”</div><div>“Well,” Rose bobbed her head, “nothing, really. I try and avoid them, and I don't usually talk back when they start in on me.”</div><div>“Hm. That seems safest to me, but I'll tell you what,” He passed her a crow that spanned her palm and was cast in silver. “Carry this. When one of them starts to give you trouble, show it to them. They'll back off.”</div><div>Rose plucked it from Willow's palm. “Why would they?”</div><div>“That crow's mine, and it's known. All of the thugs on Sweat Street report to Bel one way or another, and she's afraid of me.” Willow cracked his knuckles and smiled. “I hardly know why.”</div><div>Kimberly grinned into her blue drink, and took another sip to cover it. Then she snorted and ruined her calm mask. Willow leaned over to ruffle her hair and she squawked, flailing playfully at him with her empty hand.</div><div>“Oh, look. You can make it into a necklace.” Rose turned the figurine over. “Do you have one of these, Kimberly?”</div><div>Kimberly nodded and, still holding Willow about the waist, set down her drink and drew a small silver bird out from neck of her sweater. She caught Rose's eye, and dropped it back.</div><div>“But, then. Why didn't you show it to Jess?”</div><div>“I was going to -that's why I was talking about eyesight. Willow beat me to the punch. Did you really think I was going to tell her that she should respect a tree full of birds?”</div><div>“Regrettably, probably not. It's a shame, I have high hopes for Jessica.” Willow drained his mug while both women stared at him.</div><div>“She threatens all of us, and you have high hopes for her?” Rose asked incredulously. “Do they involve a cliff?”</div><div>“Will has high hopes for everyone. Even Bel, I'm sure.” Kimberly rolled her eyes.</div><div>Willow nodded and got to his feet, pulling on his coat and collecting Huginn. He whistled, and turned to the door, then stopped.</div><div>“Oh, yes. Huginn reminds me that I have something of yours, Rose. Muninn found it earlier.” He tossed her something small that glinted as it tumbled through the air. A tiny bronze token landed in her palm, and she looked up slowly. Willow was almost at the door, and Muninn landed on his shoulder. She heard the bird’s caw clearly through the loud music and a knot of dancers obscured her vision. When they cleared out, Willow was gone.</div><div>Rose turned to Kimberly with puzzled look. “What just happened?”</div><div>Kimberly looked down at Rose's hands, silver crow in the left and bronze-colored key in the right. “Dunno. He's just like that. I think he has dramatic urges.”</div><div>Rose looked sharply at Kimberly, who sat motionless. For her part, Kimberly studied the newest member of her family; reddish hair in ringlets framing her face, dark eyes with brows drawn close in suspicion, worried, slightly pouting lips. Kimberly smiled, then, and set down her drink. She reached out and held each of Rose’s hands in one of her own, then gently closed them. Right hand over the silver crow, left hand over the little bronze key. Still smiling, Kimberly embraced her confused cousin, and whispered in her ear.</div><div>“Welcome to the Corvus Clan.”</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Comalies</div><div>and there's nothing but white</div><div>and a featureless plain</div><div>and the whispers of devils</div><div>and the face in the rain</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Lullabye</div><div></div><div>Leo was hunched over the back of his chair.</div><div>“I don't know what the hell it was. It was like some freaking dragon slayer fantasy on acid. And speaking of freaking, I'm kind of freaking out about it. I mean, half the people I know were in the damn thing, and before I know what's really going on we're advancing on the friggin' thing like we're a sixteenth century army. Which is cool and all, I guess. But the bones that were at this thing's feet were people too, but--”</div><div>Kimberly shook her head. “What bones? You didn't mention any bones.”</div><div>“No, I had to have mentioned them. They were the bones of the lost. The people that the demon had eaten. The flesh was their flesh, but the marrow, the bones, were the soul.”</div><div>“So you're saying that this demon –made out of fire and iron and blood—was eating the flesh of people?”</div><div>The light in the lofty was dim where they sat, across the room from Leo's charge of the moment, his girlfriend's daughter. Naomi was entranced by Kipper, which appeared, to Kimberly's eye, to consist of a small white dog, a great deal of snow, and very little scenery. For itself, the apartment around the ancient floor-stand television was large, with high ceilings and windows all along one side. It was also freezing, despite the fire that Leo had built to roaring just ten feet away. Naomi played near to it, oblivious to the adults by the corner table who were making plumes of frost every time they spoke.</div><div>“Well yeah, it was. That seems like a demon thing, right? But the important bit was the soul. If the demon had cracked open the bones of the person and eaten the dream-bone-marrow, then what he was really doing was eating their soul. And I knew in my dream, that it was the most horrific thing imaginable.”</div><div>“I guess I can see that.”</div><div>“Can you? The death of a soul? No afterlife, no Nirvana or another turn on the Wheel. Just the inside of a demon as it burns away what's left of you until there's nothing to inside, no thought, no fear, nor even pain? Just mindless hurting until even that is gone and there's nothing to say 'I' anymore? It came to me in a dream, but as I stand here now, I can't think of anything that would be worse than that.”</div><div>“And you used to live in New York.”</div><div>“Okay, some of the traffic came close, but come on. Seriously.”</div><div>“Seriously, Leo? You're asking me to analyze some kind of Saint George dream. It's not like that's even my field. We could ask Willow. I...had the same dream. But that wasn't what I was doing. I remember that I had green skin. Does that help you at all? Maybe we could find some other people who remember these dreams, be able to build a better picture of what's going on?”</div><div>Leo shrugged, reached out and stirred his jar of turpentine with one of the brushes he was soaking in it. “I don't know if he'd take it seriously. And besides, what if it was just a dream and it doesn't mean anything?”</div><div>“What if it was?”</div><div>“Well, I'd feel like and idiot.”</div><div>“And you sound like you're going kind of nuts right now, obsessing over it. How long have you been thinking about this?”</div><div>“A couple of weeks. It happened right before Halloween. And let me tell you, sitting in here with the lights off so that I wouldn't get any trick-or-treaters was really fun.”</div><div>Kimberly shook her head, and stared into the middle distance. She wasn't qualified for this. Hell, I'm an art student for fuck's sake. What do I know from dreams? Or from magic. She shook her head again, trying to clear it, and spoke.</div><div>“What do you really want to know? You're talking us in circles, and I think you're trying to go somewhere with this. Where are we headed?”</div><div>“I just. I...was it real?”</div><div>Kimberly looked around Leo's apartment. To Naomi playing in front of the fire grate. TO the television and its great swathes of white. To the hardwood floor covered in rag rugs. Isabel made  those while she watched movies. Leo painted, and she crocheted. On the warm end of the apartment, canvases hung drying. In the corner, a folded easel was shrouded by a canvas tarp. The edges of a canvas poked out from under the cloth, but no more than snatches of color met Kimberly's eyes. She didn't try to peek. And as she rubbed her hands together, she thought about what Willow had told her. And what she remembered.</div><div>“It wasn't...not true,” she settled on, and sighed. She was starting to sound like the old bird.</div><div>“That doesn't tell me anything. I don't know what it was, and it's been weeks! Isabel keeps kicking me awake, telling me that I'm thrashing in my sleep. I believe her. Those dreams are terrifying. What am I supposed to do?”</div><div>Kimberly shook her head. “You should be safe. You have the token that Willow gave you?”</div><div>Leo nodded, and produced it from his pocket. He'd attached it to his keys. “It goes everywhere I do. I leave it on the bedside table when I sleep.”</div><div>“No. Put it on a necklace, or a bracelet, or something like that. Give it skin contact. That should help keep the dreams at bay, at the very least.”</div><div>“Okay. Okay I'll do that. But what am I going to do in the long run? I feel like I'm going crazy. Am I?”</div><div>“No!” Kimberly took Leo's hand. “Absolutely not! There is nothing wrong with you that simple fear can't explain. And to be honest, after that dream, I was pretty scared myself. And I was just helping Willow finish the wall around that damn creature.”</div><div>“Creature? It was more like a demon. And it was you and Willow standing by that force-field-thing?”</div><div>“That was us,” Kimberly confirmed. “I...honestly, I don't remember much. But I remember seeing you, and seeing you go down. And then it turned on Annie, and then...I don't know. I just remember this big flash of light, and all the blackbirds in Willow's crown came down like hailstones. They covered us up, or they covered the creature. I couldn't see anything, and then I woke up.”</div><div>“Really?”</div><div>“Really. Then I found Willow downstairs and shouted at him for leaving me all alone in the bed while he was doing that. It was creepy waking up alone. I thought he was gone.”</div><div>“Heh. I've gotten the sharp side of Isa's tongue for doing something like that. Is there something about you ladies that you don't like waking up alone, or is it just that you don't like waking up without your own personal source or warmth?”</div><div>“I don't think I'll dignify that with a response.”</div><div>“There's one more thing that I have to know.” And here, any humor that might have been in Leo's eyes was gone. His face smoothed into an unreadable mask with disturbing ease. “Is Naomi in danger? I can take care of myself, and so can Isa. But if this is going to be a danger to Naomi, I can't help. Or something has to be done to protect her. She cannot be at risk. Can you promise that?”</div><div>Kimberly took a moment and stared into Leo's eyes. “I think she is safe. And if there is anything that is in my power, I will do it to make her so. But if you want certainties, you should see Willow. That's all I can give you for guarantees.”</div><div>Leo pushed himself erect. Six plus feet with muscles that moved visibly under his paint-smeared tee-shirt, Kimberly could see why he wasn't afraid for himself. At least, not physically. But She could also see why he was insisting for protection for Naomi. That wasn't something that he could afford to test.</div><div>“Naomi, hun?” He said. “I'd like you to go put on your coat and boots while I close down the fire. We're going to see a friend of mine.” He turned to Kimberly. “Let's go see the wizard.”</div><div></div><div>Willow's house looked less like a cathedral in miniature in the daylight. Instead, it seemed like a rambling castle, surrounded by a village worth of gardens. There wasn't much of those gardens left at this time of year: just the raised beds made of undressed field stone, and the dead leaves that wrapped it all like a shroud. In shades of gold and brown, the yard was wide and broad under the sun. There was a driveway, crushed gravel that circled around to the back. No car presented itself to their sight, but Willow didn't really seem like the sort of person to have a vehicle.</div><div>“Here, come along,” Kimberly gestured along the yard. The stone path lay under her feet, and as she walked away toward the side door. Leo and Naomi followed, her little hand in his big one.</div><div>“Are you sure he's home? I don't see a car.” Leo had to speak up, as Kimberly gained distance from him and Naomi's small stride.</div><div>She laughed, then brought it down to a chuckle. “No, he's here.” She laid a hand upon the latch, and paused. “Sarah's with him. They're having lunch. I think there should be enough left for you and the little one.”</div><div>“Ahh, well if he was meeting her, I guess you would know where he is.”</div><div>Pausing in the act of opening the door, Kimberly cocked her head. Her brows were slightly furrowed. “I didn't know they were meeting. Come on, it smells like they're having stir-fry.”</div><div>Inside the wan light of the fall passed through the inset stained glass windows and weakened further, leaving attenuated gem colored patches on the floor and chairs. Willow had a variety of plants on his plentiful tables. Between their pleasant bulk and the impressive size of the area, there was a sense of comfortable, herbaceous space in the living room. Willow occupied the southern end of the room, next to a fire that was roaring despite the early nature of the evening. Of course, with December coming on, evening was coming earlier than ever. Willow was dressed for comfort in a loose pair of jeans and what looked like the sweatshirt Kimberly had bought him, insisting that she replace the one she had charred. That had been an argument he lost, much to her satisfaction.</div><div>He was gesturing as if to give physical shape to something he was talking about. Kimberly couldn't decide if it was in response to something Sarah had said, or if he was just obeying some notion that had climbed into his head. He heard the mahogany door slam shut –which was the only way Kimberly could close that door—and waved. No surprise entered his expression, but the smile that fell into place on his face was genuine. He gestured them over.</div><div>Leaning close to Kimberly, Leo whispered “It's weird seeing him without the birds. Are they around here somewhere?”</div><div>She shook her head. “They're not in the room, but that doesn't really mean anything. For all his broken wing –well, badly healed, I guess—Huginn gets around well enough, especially in here. His –what's the word for a limp, only in the air? Anyway, it's barely noticeable anywhere inside here. I think it's because of all the perches Willow has installed on the walls and counters. He just has to get airborne for a little while, and then he can sit for a few minutes. It looks like he's hopscotching across the room.”</div><div>Leo laughed as they headed over to Willow, and the fire. He was putting his face together for pleasantries when Willow stepped close and laid a hand on his shoulder.</div><div>“So you've lived with your dreams for more than a month, and scared, you've decided to come to us. Thank you for your trust.” And Leo's mind shook for a moment.</div><div>Those eyes that met his were black, and deeper than black. Not the black of simply dark, but the black that comes from depth. The bottom of a well, or the deepest part of the ocean where fish come with their own lights, was shallower than that look. It shot through Leo, and it sank into him, and the painter saw, in that instant, a life that could encompass his own and know it completely, intimately, in moments. Those eyes had watched the lives of women and men alike pass into memory, legend, myth, and finally to dust. They were the eyes of a god.</div><div>And then they weren't. Willow's eyes were just the same shiny oil-slick black that graced the back of his birds –his translators for the corvidae family, if you listened to him. Dark, yes. Ominous, perhaps. But unquestionably human. Willow laughed, and the man's smile grew into a grin while Leo watched unblinking, still not quite sure whether he didn't believe what he had seen, or what he was seeing.</div><div>“Not a god, Leo. Not a god. I told you that last time we spoke. I'm just old, even if I don't look it. Been around the block a time or two, and all that. I'm one of those 'old souls' you hear about.”</div><div>Kimberly snorted. “Sure thing, Will. I bet your first words when you were a baby were 'thousand yard stare'. You're creeping him out. Where's Sarah?”</div><div>“She's in the kitchen with the birds. They wanted some of the stir-fry.” Kimberly nodded and, kissing Willow, headed off in the direction of the kitchen. She pulled off her jacket and tossed it on a wing-backed chair as she went.</div><div>“So you are having stir-fry? I mean, Kimberly said you were, but I couldn't see how she'd know.”</div><div>“Oh, she has some unusual resources at her disposal. Homes are her specialty, and when it's her home, well. Let's just say that I don't tell her what's what in this house.” Then he smacked himself in the forehead with an open palm. “But where are my manners? I should offer you some food as a good host. It's chicken, kielbasa, broccoli and, I think, cantaloupe. Sarah just threw it all in one pot and told me it was food. To me, it sounds suspiciously like bachelor-food and not something for a real gourmet, but it was either eat that or cook for myself. The choice was obvious.”</div><div>“Of course. Is there somewhere Naomi and I could put our coats? It's a little warm in here for them, and I don't want to be in the way.”</div><div>“Certainly. Go ahead and just drape them over the chairs. I take it that you are Naomi?” This last addressed the little bundle of pink and purple down quilting that was made nearly hemispherical by cold-weather gear.</div><div>The pinkish hemisphere nodded, and spoke. It was muffled by a scarf.</div><div>“I didn't quite catch that. My name is Willow, but let's save the introductions for once you're out of that...quilt?”</div><div>Leo was unzipping zippers and unbuttoning buttons while Willow said this, and he spoke up without turning from his task.</div><div>“I know it's overkill, but Isa worries. For that matter, so do I. She had pneumonia when she was two, and her heart stopped twice. Her lungs still aren't as strong as they should be. She hasn't grown since then, either.”</div><div>Willow nodded, and seated himself with a motion that could only be called a plop. “I see,” and there was a flicker of those old-god eyes. “While she is here, she will have no need to fear illness or infirmity or danger. You may know that on my life and my name.” Then he shook his head, as if dismissing the matter. “Okay, Naomi, now that you're mostly rid of your heavy clothes, what would you like to do?”</div><div>There was a moment of shyness, but either Willow's charisma or her own gregariousness won out.</div><div>“ 'n I watch Kipper?”</div><div>“Umm...” Willow looked at Leo. “Did she just ask to see a fish? A kipper is still a fish, right?”</div><div>It was Leo's turn to laugh. “Kipper is Naomi's favorite teevee show. It's a British cartoon. There's a dog, and a lot of white backgrounds. Also sledding.”</div><div>“Ah. In that case, I don't think I can help. I haven't had a television since they stopped making octagonal screens. I felt that they lost their charm after that.” He turned his face back to Naomi. “I don't think you can watch it here –I haven't got any Kipper. But I think I might have some toys for you to play with. Do you like playing blocks?”</div><div>When she nodded, Willow pointed to a large chest a few feet away from the fire. “You can play with any of the blocks in there, unless they have nails in them. Those I want for my fire, and if you could bring them to me, it would be very nice.”</div><div>There was a little cherubic grin in reply, and Naomi set off, no doubt in search of nails. Willow stood and crossed to Leo's side. The man shifted his weight anxiously.</div><div>“Uhh, I'd really rather she didn't play in something with nails, Willow.”</div><div>He snorted, and laid a hand on Leo's arm.</div><div>“There haven't been any nails in that box for fifty years. It's even put together with mortise and tenon joinery. She'll pull all the wood in the box out, though, and have lots of fun making a mess. Come on, we have lots to talk about, don't we?”</div><div>Leo hesitated, and then, “I guess. I'm kind of afraid what you'll tell me.”</div><div>Shrugging, Willow drew a glass of water from under the fronds of a large fern. “I'll tell you the truth. Or if that's too harsh, I'll tell you a lie. Whatever you end up needing to get through is probably what you'll hear. So what you get depends more on you. So you tell me: am I going to give you the truth, or a lie?”</div><div>“That's a fairly bald-faced way of putting it. Some people might even call it condescending.”</div><div>“They'd be right. It is condescending. It's also true. And if you're pissed at me, you'll be better equipped for a painful truth. Calm people, people who feel safe. Those are the ones who end up loving the lie. It's more relaxing. It makes reality seem just fine, and reassures them that something that they know couldn't have happened, didn't.”</div><div>There was a long, uncomfortable moment while Willow sipped at his water while Leo tried to read him. The entire speech had been delivered deadpan, and Leo couldn't tell if he had been serious or mocking. Or if there was any difference where Willow was concerned.</div><div>“I don't know whether I want a lie or not,” Leo finally said. “I just want to be able to sleep without wondering if something's going to try to eat me. I want to wake up in the mornings knowing that I don't have to check on Naomi for any reason other than wanting to. Can you make me feel safe without lying to me?”</div><div>There was another pause, less uncomfortable than the first. Willow seemed to be weighing Leo with his eyes. When he spoke, it was with a small quirk at either end of a frown. It was like he was wearing a smile underneath a more dominant expression. Leo couldn't tell if that was a good thing or not. Willow shook his head. “No.”</div><div>“No Leo, I can't make you feel completely safe without lying to you. Would you settle for being a little less ignorant than you are now? If you knew what you were trying to protect yourself from, you'd probably feel a little better.”</div><div>As Leo thought that over, there was noise from the kitchen, and both Sarah and Kimberly emerged. Each had a bird resting on their shoulder. Huginn on Kimberly's right, Muninn on Sarah's left. The women carried three bowls of steaming food between them, and there was a bustling as Naomi was called back from making a mess, and everyone found space around the fire. The little one got her own table, made from a foot stool and a handkerchief.</div><div>Once everyone was settled, It was several minutes of eating before Leo spoke again. He directed himself to Sarah. “This is very good. Willow said there was cantaloup in it, but I don't taste any.”</div><div>Sarah blinked, and raised her eyebrows. “Cantaloup, Birdman? Really? Does that sound like something that I would put in my stir-fry?”</div><div>He raised his hands helplessly. “You told me what was in it. You said cantaloup. Perhaps I was mistaken.”</div><div>“Perhaps you were.”</div><div>Leo lifted his head suddenly. “If it's not impolite to say so, Sarah, I seem to remember you from a certain dream I had. It was just over a month ago, now. Do you remember it also?”</div><div>If he hadn't been looking for it, he would have missed the darting look Sarah sent at Willow, and his slight nod, before she spoke.</div><div>“I remember it. What did you think?”</div><div>Leo laughed, humorlessly. “What did I think? I think I've been terrified for a month. And now I want answers. Willow has said he'll give them to me. And Willow, I think I'll take the truth that unsettles me, rather than the lie that reassures. I'd rather be legitimately afraid than falsely comfortable. That last one has a habit of falling apart without warning.”</div><div>“Well, if everything goes well, there won't be any falling apart anywhere. However, I kind of doubt that everything is going to go well, because it seldom does. Not with the kind of magic that Bel and her Pack are working down on Swett street. Those spells were never meant to do good.”</div><div>“Uhh, well that sounds...intensely ominous.” Leo shook his head. “Could you try that again, but with a rumble of thunder, and maybe some horses whinnying in the background?”</div><div>Willow chuckled, and sipped again from his water. Then he pulled his legs up into the chair and sat cross-legged. “I wrote those spells. Me. It happened long ago, and I was a different person. There's no such thing as ultimate evil, that I've found. Or ultimate good, for that matter. But those spells are pretty damn evil. Eurgh, well... Not evil, per se.”</div><div>“What? How can something be 'pretty damn evil', and then not be evil, as such?” Sarah shook her head. “I call bullshit. You've tried that dodge before, but now you've got to spill it.”</div><div>Holding up his free hand, Willow made a placating gesture. “Easy, Spooky pants. I might be old, but that doesn't mean I know exactly how to explain everything.” Then he shook his head, and lowered his hand to one knee. “Those spells, they are intended to...pull...a person apart. Not physically, although can happen.” Willow shifted uneasily, as if stretching a knotted muscle. “Usually, it's emotional. You use the ritual and trance that the spell's preparation gives you in order to break yourself into parts. To pull out your anger, say. Or fear. Or hate. Or sense of right.”</div><div>“Uhh,” Leo interjected. “I hate to sound like a pop-psychologist, but wouldn't that leave whoever did it, well...hopelessly insane?”</div><div>Willow nodded. “It has happened. Often. But sometimes the user of the spells is strong enough to hold together something of who they were around the gap that they have hacked in their soul. But there's still a piece of them on the...well, call it the ethereal plane. There are parts of the spell –the majority, ideally—designed to bind it to the summoner's will. So that while you might have broken yourself, you always have that bit at your beck and call.”</div><div>“Ideally, Bird man? I don't like the sound of 'ideally'. In fact, that sounds really, really bad.”</div><div>“You're right, Sarah. The control sections of the spell aren't actually necessary. Anyone who has a shred of sanity of even self-preservation will use them. But that doesn't always happen. And in that case...well, to use Leo's pop-psychology, like handing someone with nothing but id a gun, and letting them loose in a crowded marketplace.”</div><div>Sarah shivered. “Okay, then.” She made a show of looking at her wrist, as if checking a watch. “Aaand time. You've succeeded in terrifying me. Almost ten years to do a really great job of it, Willow. Thanks.”</div><div>“You think that's scary? Try this one. Take the combined ids of Bel, and all the people she has drawn to her on this quest she's undertaken to find all the parts of my spells. Then, imagine that the resulting monstrosity gets supercharged and left almost completely without restraint. What do you think that would look like?”</div><div>And this time it was Leo who spoke. “I bet it would look a lot like a demon, all over smoke and iron, slicked with blood and wrapped close with a mantle of fire. I bet it would look a lot like a great beast on a plane of bones, full of hunger and pain and utter, dark hate. Wouldn't it?”</div><div>“It would look a lot like that, Leo. Exactly like, in fact. And to make it better? Bel is the only one of those cretins down on Swett street with the power to control herself the way one must, if the spell is to be performed without a resulting...well, catastrophe.”</div><div>Kimberly looked somewhat lost. “But, isn't that a good thing? I mean, that means that the others can't make it do anything, doesn't it?”</div><div>Willow made a face, then shook his head. “Not quite. Sure, they can't make their crazy personality-shard do anything, but none of them can stop it from doing anything, either. Only Bel can. And she's only really strong enough to stop hers. And there are more than a dozen members of the Pack. Sure, only maybe six or so had enough power to actually bind themselves to her construct, but there were a half a score more pouring personal energy into it. In addition to making the spell easier, they'll be like batteries that it can tap if it needs more strength.”</div><div>Leo swallowed. “This sounds utterly horrible. How do you stop something like that? How can you? Or anyone?”</div><div>“Actually, the easy way is very easy.”</div><div>“Well, why don't we do that? It sounds like this thing would be devastating if it got let off the leash, and you're telling us pretty frankly that no one has the spunk to hold on if the damn thing decides that it wants out.”</div><div>Willow looked at the floor. “That's all well and good, but when I say easy, I mean just that. The demon draws its power from such of its original creators as are still alive, unless certain provisions are made. Bel and the others haven't. They are, as far as I am aware, unable to. I destroyed the traces of that part of the spell completely, I think.”</div><div>“Birdman...still alive?”</div><div>“Exactly. The easy way out is to kill Bel, and her friends, and their friends. Twenty lives? More? I don't know exactly how many people are in on this. And I don't know how many might not know they are. Some little fourteen year old boy who thinks he's getting into Wicca, Wicca, for fucks sake –as if there was something less harmless than Wicca—so he does a fragment of a spell with someone else. An older mentor, maybe. Enough to make him part of it. Enough that he's something that the demon can ride. As if it were some Voudon loa called down to sit on his spirit.</div><div>“So more than twenty lives. How many more, I don't know. But it would be a bloodbath. And I would be responsible. What do you think, Leo? Can I do that, to make sure no one else gets hurt? Would that be right?”</div><div>Leo shrunk into his chair more and more as Willow's voice got louder. Still more as the man stood and began gesturing. His birds leapt into flight and landed on his shoulders as he turned suddenly and moved toward Leo. Willow didn't look like a twenty-something man dressed for comfort anymore. Somewhere between one turn and another, the earth-toned sweatshirt and blue jeans had ceased to be items of clothing and turned into powerful artifacts. With the birds on his shoulders, it looked like the very shadows of the room were gathering around Willow to form a dark, dark cloak. His face was terrible to behold and it shone a bright white that was not, Leo somehow knew, a reflection of the fire. His eyes were as the darkness of dead stars. Leo felt himself break out in the fear-sweat of those who knew that they were already dead, saving only the trivial task of the death-blow.</div><div>And then he wasn't, and the eyes before him weren't. Not anymore. Again, Willow looked like a man. Slightly ridiculous, even, with the great ravens perched on his shoulders. Willow turned away and moved to the hearth. He faced the fire, and sighed.</div><div>“I'm sorry. You didn't deserve that, and it was heartless of me to say it. This has been—no. No excuses. I apologize.”</div><div>“It's,” Leo opened his mouth to say 'okay', but stopped. It hadn't been okay, it had been damned terrifying. He settled for, “It's nothing that did me harm. Would you really have hurt me?”</div><div>Willow shook his head, and shrunk back down, in Leo's eyes, to the stature of a man. “No. And even if I would have, Sarah would have stopped me. Or Kimberly. Or Huginn and Muninn. They are all dear to me, and they all have power—influence, each in their own way. You would not have been hurt.”</div><div>The fire filled several moments of silence, snapping occasionally and otherwise filled with the quiet crackle of burning hardwood. Then,</div><div>“Would you have harmed Naomi?”</div><div>Willow was shaking his head before the question was even out.</div><div>“No, in no way would I have harmed her. She's a child. I would see my life burned out and my existence smeared into nothingness first. It would be the undoing of myself and the whole of my life's thread, and I would rather not have existed than hurt a child. When I have her the protection of my life and name, that was not a formality. It was a promise.”</div><div>“You're very serious.”</div><div>“So are you.”</div><div>“I mean, normally you would have just tossed that whole episode off with a joke, or told me that you were kidding or acting. Why didn't you?”</div><div>“Because I wasn't kidding. That anger was real, and you shouldn't have seen it. But I'm thinking about this all the time, banter and laughs that you hear from me non-withstanding. And I find myself spun about in circles trying to find a way out that doesn't end with the line 'and then they all died'.”</div><div>Kimberly and Sarah, bracketing the fire, didn't say 'are you serious', or even 'is it really that bad', and Leo felt that they had missed an opportunity. But their faces were somber, and he took the hint. The sweat on his face was evaporating in the head of the fire, and he stood. Some feet from the hearth, and he felt as if he were lightly steaming. Willow stood inches from the bare flames, and showed no sign of the temperature. His pants should have been afire, to say nothing of the burns that kind of heat would give.</div><div>And yet Willow stood there, without moving, until Leo touched his arm just below the shoulder. He twitched, and Leo pulled his hands back. Willow's flesh was every bit as hot as the fire.</div><div>“What...are you?”</div><div>And Naomi chose that minute to walk as purposefully as a four-year-old can over to Willow and reach out to grab his leg. Leo jumped for her, but he had to make it around Willow to get her. All Willow himself had to do was bend and twist. He did, and lifted the girl in his arms. She showed no sign of pain, and was holding out a piece of wood almost the same length as her torso.</div><div>“There's no nails. Do you want this anyway?”</div><div>Willow looked speculatively at the wood in her hands, and then at the fire.</div><div>“Well, I suppose we could put that on. It is getting dark after all, and I believe that we want to have some light. Don't you agree?”</div><div>Naomi nodded solemnly, and held out the wood again.</div><div>“Mommy says I can't put things in the fire until I'm older.”</div><div>“Really? How much older did she say you had to be?”</div><div>The girl held out her free hand, all fingers extended, and dropped the wood against Willow's chest to hold out three more fingers on that hand.</div><div>“This many years.”</div><div>“You have to be eight years old? That seems like a good age. How many years are you right now?”</div><div>She curled all but four fingers on her left hand.</div><div>“Wow, you're pretty old for somebody so small. But you know what? I was pretty small when I was four years old, too. I just got bigger later. I bet you do the same thing. Here, Leo, take her. I'll throw the wood on the fire.”</div><div>And Leo, who had straitened from his lunge for the child slowly, took Naomi from him with the same slow deliberation. Willow's skin was merely warm, just the heat of a normal man standing before a blaze.</div><div>“Thank you.”</div><div>“Like I said, she's safe as long as I can keep her safe.”</div><div>Naomi watched Willow set the wood in the center of the fire. The coals flashed white, and the remains of what looked like a piece of ceiling strapping burst into flame. Leaving it sitting in the ceiling of a house for fifty or a hundred years was a good way to season wood. If a little inefficient. When he turned around to face Leo and his –for all intents and purposes—daughter, the mask of humanity was pulled perfectly into place again. He was a man, smiling and gesturing at the chairs. He was a man fanning it his pants as if they were a bit too hot for comfort. He was a man speaking.</div><div>“And speaking of safety, I take it that you have the pendant I gave you?”</div><div>“Making it a necklace will help, yes. There are some calming charms in the silver. But I'm pretty sure that the nightmares aren't coming from the outside. You're scared just short of peeing your pants, and that's the big problem. I bet you haven't been painting very much, have you?”</div><div>Leo gave him a sharp look. “No, I haven't. And when I try to,” he shook his head. “I just paint the field. It's hideous. Oh, the painting itself looks good enough, but the subject is, well. You know.”</div><div>Willow nodded. “I know. It's not half ugly, isn't it? All those bones and the bloody twilight. I don't suppose you got the wall in, perhaps? That might be a handy additoin to the binding that Kimberly and I tried to slap down on it.”</div><div>“No, I couldn't get the translucence right. And the light it was giving off, it just wouldn't lay right on the beast.”</div><div>Willow's head snapped around. “What! You actually painted the demon? Authentically?”</div><div>“What do you mean, 'authentically'? It looks like I remember it, if that's what you're asking.” With Naomi in one hand, he tried to gesture, failed to convey his meaning, and spoke again. “I didn't get it down perfectly, I'm pretty sure. Is that what you meant?”</div><div>Willow was standing and pulling on a coat that seemed to have come from nowhere. “No, it is not. We are leaving now. You left it in your apartment, I take it?”</div><div>Leo nodded, and began to dress Naomi for the cold when Willow waved it away.</div><div>“There is no need for that. I will keep us all quite warm enough. Kimberly! Sarah! Come with us, please. You might need to protect Leo and Naomi.”</div><div>“I don't understand, it's just a painting, isn't it?” Leo shook his head. “I mean, you said the nightmares were all in my head, right? Why does a painting change that?”</div><div>Willow growled, a surprisingly accurate and animalistic noise. “Because of the law of sympathy. It's a magic thing.” He ushered them out the door and closed it. He didn't set the lock on the way out, and oddly enough, he'd been right. Though the  November wind tore around them, and the slushy snow that dominated most of the city was still there, around Willow there was a circle of warmth. They didn't need their coats, and in his wake the man left the ground dry and clear.</div><div>”The general idea is that the more something resembles an object, the more you can do magic to the object, and affect the thing.”</div><div>“So? I'm a painter, not a warlock! It's not like I've been doing blood sacrifices to the damn thing!”</div><div>“It's not that simple. It works both ways. The more your painting is like the demon, the more the demon can affect the painting. Have you turned your eyes away from it for a second, and then looked back to find the figure that you're painting it in a different position?”</div><div>And now Leo was scared. He had been frightened, when Willow as angry, and when he thought about the painting that they were rushing back to his loft to retrieve. But he hadn't been really scared. Now he was.</div><div>“I thought it was just my imagination.”</div><div>“Well, it might have started out that way, but not anymore. In fact, I'm currently quite doubtful that your nightmares have had anything to do with you at all. The beast has tasted your blood, and then you obligingly painted it a doorway and fed it with your fear. You built it a home and a physical body, any now it will be growing in power. If it wants to do anything with a body of paint, it's going to have to expend a lot of energy to turn it into something that it can use. But you've given it a really great foothold.”</div><div>“I didn't know!” He squeezed Naomi to him. Whether he was trying to comfort her or himself, it wasn't clear.</div><div>“Das mas nichts. That doesn't matter. Well, it probably does. If someone else had painted it, with the intent to free the beast, it would have been much more effective. It might even be roaming the city by now, and that would be one of those stories that end with the words 'then everybody died'. But now, it's probably just gathering strength, and you fought it before, so you'll have fought it again when it tried to take you for its own. Your dreams were of the fight, weren't they? With slightly different events each time?”</div><div>“Yes,” and they were nearing his loft now. He couldn't see the windows, but they would be in view after a couple more turns. “At first, you were all there, and these last couple of weeks, it's just been me.”</div><div>Willow nodded. Our fading influence would have helped. Maybe even pulled some of the weaker dreamers into your nightmare to help you. But you can't risk that thing getting out. We're going to burn it. And your easel. And any of the brushes you used. Same thing with the paints.”</div><div>“What? Why? I understand the painting, but the rest?”</div><div>“Law of sympathy again. The paints and brushes and easel and so on are all 'like' the canvas and wood and paint that are working together to represent the creature. We could burn the painting, and it would still come through. It would take a hell of a lot longer, but it would still happen. Any links beyond that –like trees from the wood the brushes were made from, or through the fur of the camels that provided the brush tips, for example—wouldn't really work. Too diffuse, and the land can fight back.”</div><div>“What do you mean the land can fight back?”</div><div>Willow slowed briefly, and gave Leo an odd look. “Where do you think I get most of my power? Or Kimberly? Or anyone, for that matter? I mean, she and I have deeper wells than most people, so to speak.” He threw his arms wide, and started walking backwards, still at an extreme pace.</div><div>“But we still have to get it from somewhere. It's flowing under us at this very minute. In the turn of the earth, and the sun shine, and the strength of the wind. It's all there. You just have to be able to feel it. And it has some opinions.”</div><div>Shaking his head, Willow spun about to face front. “Apparently, raising demons is okay, because that's just the business of sentient creatures. But trying to mess with the earth itself? That sort of thing doesn't go over very well.”</div><div>Leo shook his head again. “I still don't know if I believe any of this. The whole land-being-alive thing is a bit much for me. But I'm still up for a really big fire. Come on, this is my buil—” He looked up, and stopped. The light was on.</div><div>“The light's on. The light is never on. Isabel's not due home for another,” here, he looked at his watch, dial flashing blue as he raised his hand. “Three hours. Who the hell is in my apartment?” He turned to Willow with a question on his lips, only to find that Willow was gone, with Sarah.</div><div>Kimberly was at his elbow, urging him inside. They broke into a run, and Naomi started crying as they ran past the wreckage of what had been a steel security door. Now it looked like a giants crumpled handkerchief, and as they streaked up the stairs Leo dimly registered that it would be a perfect piece of corporate art.</div><div>Above his head, there was at least one set of boots pounding up the treads. The harsh, insistent sound got into Leo's head, and his own feet matched the pace, tried to better it, and caught up with Sarah only to reach his landing just as Willow returned from someplace up the hall. He didn't appear to move, he swarmed, almost as if her were less a person than a collection of shadows. His face was set in anger, and a wild wind stirred in his wake.</div><div>There was some dim red light handing about the door, and when Willow touched the handle, it flared brighter.</div><div>“What the hell is that?” he asked.</div><div>Willow made no reply, and instead squared his shoulders and took a couple of steps back. It looked like he was going to ram the door, and Leo had a sudden vision of the security door, solid steel wadded like a tissue.</div><div>Taking two swift steps, Willow slammed his shoulder against the hinge side of the door. It was the same thing Leo had to do in order to get the stiff mechanism to let him in at all.</div><div> The door burst inward, not merely off the hinges, but away from itself. It wasn't quite demolished and indeed, Leo could see parts that were fairly recognizable as chunks of wooden paneling, but there weren't many. As Willow stormed into the room, the frame cracked and smoked. When his ravens cawed, the boards and sections of the wall just buckled outward. His front door now resembled the round top of a service hatch or a sewer grate. The only difference was that this one was eight feet round, rather than two.</div><div>Moving like mercury down a sheet of paper, Willow moved to the center of the room. His head was panning back and forth as he looked for the painting, and Leo pointed to the corner where he had been keeping it.</div><div>Where it no longer was. The easel was on the ground, as was the cloth Leo had left covering the canvas. One window blew open and closed as the constantly moving air whipped up to gale speed for a moment, then calmed. At Willow's feet, bubbling finish cooled and smoothed, until you couldn't tell that they had been ready to burst into flames. Huginn and Muninn settled on his shoulders and, after a few moments conference, began to preen their feathers. Willow spoke without turning around, just as Kimberly and Sarah entered the room.</div><div>“It's gone. One of the Pack took it. Probably their seer. Here, and gone again. Like a shadow into the night.” Willow shook his head and turned to walk out. At the widened doorway, he paused and laid his hands on Kimberly's shoulder, and Sarah's.</div><div>Please, help him get settled. He shouldn't have nightmares, but the two of you should stay here with him, Naomi, and Isabel tonight. Make my excuses for me, and lay the damage at my feet. I have to go. Now. Remember to burn the materials.”</div><div>And he walked out, his feet making no sound on the old wooden floors. Kimberly and Sarah went to Leo and tried to comfort the crying Naomi. Willow disappeared, like a shadow into the night.</div><div></div><div>Minor Keys</div><div></div><div>    If life's all set in a minor key,</div><div>and I feel the dark closing in on me,</div><div>if Bela Lugosi's an old-world friend,</div><div>and hate and fear affect the end,</div><div>What's the smart play,</div><div>how do I gimmick the game,</div><div>how do I gimmick the game,</div><div>Or is my work in vain?</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, Jiggered Tune</div><div></div><div>Bel adjusted her arm inside her coat. She had tried to go along with Robin's suggestion as far as she could. Rather than a sling, she had belted the arm against her body. She could hide the belt under her coat, and if anyone saw the arm, it would look as if she had casually slid it into a pocket. Not knowing that there was nothing in that pocket, that might make her injured arm look like a threat, as well. If she were fingering the hilt of some hidden weapon, it would look much the same. Which was, after all, the point.</div><div>She was standing in the living room of her house. She stood there a lot, lately. They had put together a kind of crude easel to keep the painting that Mary had stolen up at eye level. It was a good painting. And in her memory, Bel could see the field of bones, that desolate place where she had made a home for her watchdog. Somehow, she was getting the feeling that it wasn't quite her dog anymore. She could certainly sic it on whom she chose, but calling it back that night hadn't been easy. She wasn't sure she had even done it alone. There had been that burst of power when it tried to resist her. It hadn't been any of the Pack. She knew that much. Their energy, their minds, she knew inside and out.</div><div>The symbols drawn on the floor in chalk that had ornamented the floor for months, drawn to hold and channel their power during the ritual, were gone. Instead, they had been replaced with the same circles and circles, charred into the wood. Someone –and it had to have been either Mary or Jess, Bel knew—had taken a kitchen knife and held it in the flame until it had glowed the orange of straw. She could see it in her mind as if she had been there. Then, with the blade glowing like that, Jess or Mary had carefully followed the lines that Bel had laid down and imperfectly erased. The chanting as they cut must have been done from memory, The binding and breaking, the ordering of the spirit that kept it apart from its hosts.</div><div>Bel had left a ragged shred of cloth that had been a curtain in a former life hanging over the painting. The bottom edges of the painting were protruding from under this ragged cloth, but the plain of bones didn't phase her as much as seeing the beast did. It really was everything she had wanted. It was great, and it was scary, and it was—</div><div>“So you like it, then.”</div><div>Mary had gotten behind her, and Bel stood very still. “I respect it.” Then she turned. “I never said that I liked it. It's a rabid animal that we hold by a very thin leash. And don't forget that if it slips that leash, the first thing it will do is give all of us involved a very permanent mauling.”</div><div>Mary fingered some of her more recent scars. “I don't forget anything, you should know that. 'Scars are how we remember that the past was real', remember? And I've seen more than you think. There are pathways hidden in me that I don't even know. With the construct acting like a buffer, I'm seeing more clearly by the day.”</div><div>Bel shook her head. Cutting part of her out was one thing. That could be good. There were parts of herself that she didn't ever want to see again. But Mary...chopping your personality into mincemeat and then asking it what to do seemed like a stupid idea to Bel, but she hadn't kept her cabal around her by being a gentle soul. If Mary wanted to get eaten by her id, that wasn't Bel's business. Just as long as she didn't threaten to break the control that Bel had over the construct, Mary could do anything she wanted.</div><div>“That's great, but you stole from one of the wizard's pets to get it. Don't do something like this again.”</div><div>“We all know you're afraid of him. He might be powerful, but he's no good. He can't be, or he'd be out here with us.” Mary slid one finger over the electrical tape on her arms, counting ridges. On five, she stopped her finger and thought for a moment before speaking. “Why do you think he's so upset that we're doing the ritual? It can't affect him, as powerful as you say he is.”</div><div>“This is unimaginable power. Maybe he's already done it, and just wants to keep anyone else from getting in on his party.” Bel kept her suspicions about the man's ravens to herself. Those birds were more than just birds. They might even be conduits to his power She made a note to try to kill them. If he died, so much the better. If not, well, the trauma would make something for the construct to feed off. It was getting harder to feed now, as if its appetite had magnified immensely. Bel could always feel its presence crouching in the back of her skull, telling her to go for the throat.</div><div>“What?” She snapped, bringing her head up from a staring contemplation of the rag covering the painting that this 'Leo' had done. And when Mary began to elaborate, Bel shook her head. It wasn't the time for more magic now. She cut off the bandaged seer.</div><div>“Tell me about this Leo. You said that he had a daughter, a wife?”</div><div>“He does. She's not really his wife, and the child isn't his either. But he cares for them as if they were. There were some indications in the apartment itself. And when I touched things there, I saw other things. He would do anything for them. That might be a way to make him buckle. If his woman suffers some terrible accident on the way home, it might put him in a mood less likely to fight back.”</div><div>“Or it might make him into a determined crusader with every intent to hunt us to the death.”</div><div>“But isn't that the point of the watch dog? The more anger it has to fight, the more it gets to eat?</div><div>Bel shook her head. “Psychic trauma's no good if there's no damned psyche. Think about a lobotomy patient. If we kill his wife and daughter then he'll be about as self aware as a bucket of paint. There's no way for the construct to get a hold in his mind, because there isn't anyone home.”</div><div>“Are you sure?” Mary squeezed her arms together across her chest. It looked like she was trying to hug herself and failing because there wasn't enough there to hug. Or as least not enough that wasn't scar tissue numbed from the sort of damage her body was never meant to handle.</div><div>“Trust me. The instructions were very clear on this. Pretty much the only thing that can hurt us with the construct on our side is a mindless zombie, because anything else the construct can destroy with mental trauma.” Bel made a tearing motion with her hands, as if shredding paper. “But what you're trying to do is make just the sort of thing that would put us in danger –a zombie with a purpose and no reason or even ability to stop. So don't do it.”</div><div>“I don't really think that breaking his family would break him. He's pretty self-centered. He probably wouldn't even feel that much. Maybe some superficial tears, but beyond that, it'd just be faking a good show so that people don't judge him. It would be easier to make him into a straw dummy of a person than it would be a zombie.”</div><div>Bel sighed. “He isn't all I'm worried about. This theft of yours worries me all by itself. He's one of the bird man's personal little guard or family or whatever the hell he calls it. So that means that Willow is going to be involved, if he isn't involved in anything in this damn city anyway. And I suspect that if we start murdering his friends, he's not going to be content trying to wall up the construct in its own little world.”</div><div>“But—”</div><div>Cutting her off, Bel's hand snaked out and clamped on Mary's throat. “Let me make this very clear. We are not in a democracy. You do as you are told or you die.” She dug her fingers, blunt nailed and clean, deeper into flesh. “You have seen the demon we have created. Do you think, even for a second, that it wants anything less than blood sacrifice?”</div><div>Mary tried to speak, and Bel shook her, hard. “Shut up. You are raising our profile. I want it to be low. You are pissing of the bird man, and I don't want that until the construct is done. And now it won't be for months. So if you antagonize him, or his people, without my express order, I will kill you and use your blood to empower my creation. And it will fuel its chaos and unnatural life with your screaming soul. Are we clear?”</div><div>Mary nodded, and Bel dropped her. “Get out. Now.”</div><div>And she left, while Bel stared at her hand. She had been only a handspan from ripping that woman's throat out. She shook her head. For now, she needed Mary. But that was the construct in the back of her head, shouting for blood, too. Always more, always hungry. But that was the other side of being safe. She had a sort of protection now, in the creature. It wouldn't be any good over distances, but it would act to keep her safe. It needed her. If she died, most of the spell would collapse on its own, and the creature that was really a collection of personality traits would fragment.</div><div>But they wouldn't re-integrate. That was a one-way street. Mad, weak, and plentiful, the emotions that powered her demon would be running around free and without any sort of governing intelligence. It might live, but it wouldn't have the sense of identity that it had now. That cohesiveness was its main way to focus its power. Like how black powder doesn't explode unless it's in a confined space, it just burns quickly. It would turn into a bunch of evil little semi-intelligent demons.</div><div>Probably. Bel wasn't quite sure, but that's what the instructions seemed to be hinting at. It never got into the specifics. They were written for someone who already had all the basics, but she was rebuilding the basics from this advanced text. Bel shook her head, and left the room. The charred symbols on the floor smeared as she walked on them, but the way they were burned into the floor, that symbolic link wouldn't be broken by anything short of a large-scale seismic event.</div><div>She walked through the aging kitchen and spotted a book of quotations on the table, which shook as she lifted the tome. She flipped it open to a random page near the middle, and started reading.</div><div>“Put aside from yourself that 'I have been wronged', and with it will go the feeling. Reject your sense of injury and injury itself disappears.”</div><div>It was by Marcus Aurelius Antinous, and Bel snorted at the idea. Flexing her arm, she thought it was easy enough for a philosopher who happened to be a Roman Emperor to just reject a feeling of being wronged. But he had all kinds of power, and if he actually felt a grievance, he could make sure that someone died, 'for the good of the empire', which mean for the good of the Emperor. But that sort of thing didn't make it into the history books, let alone the books of quotations.</div><div>She closed the book and dropped it back onto the table, which shuddered under the impact and caused the cups scattered across it to rattle. Bel picked up the cups and deposited them in the sink. She'd do the dishes later. For now, she had to review the details of the ceremony for the night. The painting changed everything. She could feel it, like a muscle knot just under her sternum. Everything was different, and she didn't know how. And she wasn't sure how to control it. But maybe the spell would tell her. It was all in there, she was convinced. Her own personal Bible. Or maybe Gnostic Gospels. That seemed more appropriate, somehow.</div><div>So she went upstairs to study her tattered codex, and under the surface of the paint, a demon shifted, and tested, and planned. Bel could feel it, but didn't know what she was feeling. She was very young, after all. And she had plans of her own.</div><div></div><div>Hours later, as dusk straddled the city, Robin didn't know what he was doing. Clouds lay low and threatening over the city, and the gray light of late fall didn't alleviate the grim mood they engendered. His coat was red leather, and short in the torso. It barely brushed the top edge of his broad belt, also red leather. It left him freezing when the wind blew, because though it broke the streaming air coming from behind him he left it open in the front. It was zippered from where it rested on his hips to his belly button, and from there to the collar he had left it gaping open. The zephyrs gamboled about his ribs and slipped through the thin tee shirt of black cotton he was wearing. The only place his chest wasn't cold was under his left arm, where he kept his serviceable Glock in a fast-draw shoulder holster. It radiated his own body heat back at him through the thin nylon holder, and was the reason he left his jacket mostly open.</div><div>Standing at the mouth of Swett street, Robin could feel eyes watching him. This place had once been low-income housing, and now it was either owned by some slum-lord in California, or just abandoned. He didn't know which, but as far as any residents on the street were concerned, it didn't matter. The houses were rotting where they stood. Slowly falling back into the dust from which they had come.</div><div>The pavement was as broken as a road in the midst of being resurfaced, without the promise of an actual new surface anywhere on the horizon. One patch in particular, only a few feet in diameter, appeared to have been completely obliterated. Only chunks of tar the size of driveway gravel filled it. The answer to the unspoken question of what destroyed it was answered by the washing machine a few feet away, closer to the edge of the road. It looked to have been pushed or dragged there, and looking up, Robin could see a splintered window frame on the fourth floor of a sagging house. There was Tyvek and plastic vapor-barrier up over the empty place where the window itself should have been.</div><div>He shouldn't be here. That much he knew. But the woman intrigued him. So he would see what he could see, and then find out whether she would talk to him here. If she was in her place of refuge, maybe she'd feel more at ease. And less likely to slug him. Robin rubbed his jaw in memory. He healed quickly, but there was still a lingering ache in his head, and now and then the jawbone popped unexpectedly. Sighing, Robin muttered to himself.</div><div>“If I don't do this now, I'm not going to do it at all. And there was all that business with the painting that Kimberly told me about, too. Maybe I can get a look around and see if it's really here.”</div><div>And Robin resettled his zipper a little lower, and made sure his gun would draw easily, and he took his first step into Swett street. And he could have sworn he heard laughter ringing faintly from the buildings. Whether from his hesitation, or his willingness to enter, he didn't know. And he wasn't sure which would have been worse.</div><div>He didn't know which house was hers, but he didn't have to look. As he walked down the street –slowly, stiff-legged like a territorial cat—a house that might have been white in its previous existence creaked open a few inches. Then it slammed through one hundred and eighty degrees and banged off the wall it hung from. It might also have ripped one of the hinges free. Robin couldn't tell if the damage was new, or if the rusted third hinge had been broken before the door opened.</div><div>“What the hell are you doing here?”</div><div>“Not quite the reception I expected,” Robin replied. “You did offer to work on a few of my songs with me.”</div><div>Bel gathered her coat around her with one arm. The other was deeply entrenched in her pocket. There was movement there, and Robin couldn't tell what she was doing. Fingering some bauble, perhaps, or caressing the hilt of a knife. He'd hidden knives strapped to his legs before. You cut open the lining of your jeans and the pocket on that side, and you could reach down and come out with a great mucking bowie knife. And you didn't even risk cutting your own thighs to ribbons. Much.</div><div>“Not here, I didn't,” Bel said, shaking her head. “You should go now. Or someone is going to get hurt. It won't be me again, so I think that means you're on the menu.”</div><div>“Well,” and here Robin stared at the sky for a moment, as if in speculation. “I wouldn't really mind being popped in the jaw again for the pleasure of your company, though I'd like to avoid it if possible. But your, ahh, roommates would object to my presence, would they?”</div><div>“You could say that.”</div><div>The wind picked up, and rather than just a gusting, fitful breeze, a steady river of air ran the length of the street, pulling Robin's jacket wide and flashing the contents to Bel. He didn't move when she reacted, with a little gasp, to his armament.</div><div>“You came here with a damn gun? I thought you wanted to work on music. But instead you bring a weapon?”</div><div>“I bring a weapon everywhere: don't feel special. If it makes you feel any better, I don't have any plans to use it on anyone at all. Provided I'm not attacked.”</div><div>“And if you are?”</div><div>“If I am, then I'm prepared to defend myself. The bullets are Teflon-coated, so as long as whomever makes it to the hospital, they should live.”</div><div>Bel stepped closer to the edge of the door, as if she were considering diving behind it for cover. Her black coat flapped in the wind, and Robin could see, briefly, the belt that held her arm immobile against her body. She wasn't reaching for a weapon, she was trying to let herself heal. Feeling a flush of pleasure that Bel had taken his advice, Robin stepped closer to the porch.</div><div>“Come on, I'm not trying to piss anyone off. It's just a little music. If no one else around here likes it, we can find someplace else to go. The club's not open tonight. Nice big bar, nobody around, no place where anyone could be hiding...” He wished that it could sound like a joke, but the skin between his shoulder blades was crawling, and told him he was right. ”It sounds like a good time to me.”</div><div>“It sounds like an attempt to seduce me,” Bel said flatly.</div><div>“I, wait: what?”</div><div>“Aren't you paying attention? It sounds like you're trying to seduce me. Did Willow put you up to this? That's got to be it. After he heard that I didn't kill you in the loft, he sent you down here so he could have an emotional arm lock on me. Well fuck that, and you. Get out.”</div><div>Robin shook his head and raised on hand to his temple. “No, no, not yet. I'm trying to figure out how exactly my coming over to talk to you about music translates to sex. And how that translates into some kind of emotional attachment. These are all related things, I guess, but they aren't exactly synonymous.”</div><div>“Forgive me if I find your assertions less than compelling.” The acid in her tone could have melted iron. ”You're one of the bird man's little playmates. You might not have been dangerous before, but now you're a little birdie with talons, and I don't want to get scratched. It's not anything personal.”</div><div>“Oh, come on. Yes, Willow is my friend. That doesn't mean that I'm at his beck and call, and it certainly doesn't mean that he can choose my other friends for me.”</div><div>“I am not your friend,” Bel said flatly.</div><div>“Yeah, you don't seem interested in the position, now that you mention it. What a surprise. Here I thought that you and I might be able to get along.” Robin turned to leave, and found two men behind him. Not close enough to touch, but not far out of reach, either. One was tall and blond. Nordic looking in the hair style and face shape. He had the sort of musculature that would have made Tyr jealous. He had two hands, too. That might have made Tyr jealous, as well.</div><div>The other was a slight, dark-complected boy. Well, thought Robin, he's not that young, but he's got that sort of look. He'll be a boy until something bad happens to him. Although those eyes looked plenty haunted, the kid had the demeanor of an abused puppy, not a hurt man.</div><div>The sound of doors opening behind him caught his attention, and Robin half-turned to see someone swathed in silver coming out, along with a woman covered from neck to ankles to wrists in many layers of thin, flowing material. Pretty, in a superficial way. The one clad in silver held two knives in each hand, and Robin revised his chances upward several per cent, and the rest of the people present down several more. If the girl didn't know how to handle the blades she carried, she was their liability.</div><div>Then he saw how two more blades materialized in her hand, and reconsidered his opinion. If she was really that good, he might be in for a little bleeding. Robin sighed. And he had just gotten done healing from the last time he'd involved himself with these people.</div><div>Robin sighed. “Bel, there people really don't want to try to keep me from leaving. I will protest very strongly if they do anything other than moving aside peacefully.”</div><div>“You're going to protest strongly? And what will that do? Somehow make you puncture resistant? See, I've found that what most conscientious objectors to violence is that passivity doesn't make you bullet proof.”</div><div>“Funny you should mention being bullet proof.” They had knives. And, when he looked back at the Nordic looking man with the open shirt, a small machete had appeared from somewhere. Robin drew his gun, and hoped he could use it before they closed the distance to him. As it was, he was going to end up with gunpowder all over him, which would link him convincingly to the scene of a crime. Robin didn't like cops. He had a hunch that he really wouldn't like it if he had to defend himself in court. He checked the safety on his gun. Off.</div><div>Taking a deep breath, he clicked it to the 'on' setting. Then he cocked the hammer and looked at Bel. The kept the one dressed all in silver and the dark boy in his line of sight, as well. If the Nordic one tried something, the boy would move and give him warning.</div><div>“Are you sure you don't want to say something? This could get very ugly.”</div><div>Bel's face was bunched in anger.</div><div>“If it does, you brought it on yourself. I told you to leave. If you had then, you would have gotten to.”</div><div>“I thought you ran this street.” The kid sidled a little closer, and further into his line of sight. That meant the little Viking wannabe was probably doing something similar, or stepping around behind. Either way, the machete that he had would probably by able to reach him in a moment or two.</div><div>“Don't go appealing to my sense of pride. It'll do my pride plenty good to see you spread open like an offering to the gods in the middle of my street. Bel ignored his gun and stepped off the porch. He hips swayed as she came closer. It was almost hypnotic, watching her. She looked like a street urchin, and she talked like a logger or a dog-private, but there was something about her that screamed woman to him. Something about her eyes, maybe. And as he focused on her eyes, he saw something in them. A flicker of fear and indecision, perhaps. It was enough for Robin, who spun and brought his gun around to face front, where the wannabe was stepping in and bringing the machete around in his right hand.</div><div>Robin blocked high on the arm with both his left hand, which was empty, and his right, which held the gun. Then he dropped his weight and spun again to bring the pistol's butt down across the orbit of the wannabe's right eye. He sagged to his knees, so Robin his him again. This time he went all the way down, and Robin used the same blow a third time for good measure before springing over the slumped body and snagging the machete with his left hand. From his new position, he could see all four of the individuals on the street who remained standing.</div><div>The boy looked shocked, as did the woman in her diaphanous dress. It was impossible to read any expression on the badly scarred face of the woman in silver. Bel just looked down at her Nordic giant. He was still, but breathing. Lifting her gaze to Robin, she said, “He's still alive, you know.” It sounded as if she were trying to get him to take out the garbage. Her tone had all the sonic overtones of someone reminding a young and slightly wayward child that a task remained uncompleted. Robin decided to ignore the tone.</div><div>“You're welcome.”</div><div>And he turned his back to walk away. But as he walked, he snapped the safely off. There was a slight sound, as of jingling silver, and he tensed across the shoulders. Robin waited for the bright sting of steel in his back, in his legs. His head? Probably not. Too small a target, too far away. But before there could be the sound of a knife released to fly, there was a quiet, cloth-like sound. As of denim moving against denim, followed by a jangling of chains. To his left, a bright shard of light scythed through the air to land some distance ahead of him.</div><div>He still didn't turn. Behind him, there were two sharp, hard sounds. Krak! Krak! Not the sound of a one-two punch, a left jab and right follow through or vice versa, but two fully wound one-hand punches. The sort of punches that someone with one hand tied down by a belt would throw. There was a great rattling of chains, and the sound of another body hitting the abused pavement. As he gained distance the voices of what might have been an argument were raised from a body on the ground, and there was another krak! And then there was no more argument. As he left Swett street, Robin permitted himself a tight-lipped smile, and a bit of relief that he wasn't dead. The streetlight clicked on, and Robin stared up at the back end of dusk. Night was coming on, but that wasn't so bad. He'd spent nights alone before.</div><div></div><div>The night had a texture while he was playing. There was the silence of it, and the activity. Little things moving in the dark, and the darkness dancing across the sky. In his club, the texture of the night was cool and smooth, punctuated by his playing. The battered acoustic guitar in his lap sounded freely in the enormous space, and the back echoes built interesting harmonies that hummed into silence and flavored the darkness more.</div><div>He had pulled the table to the edge of the loft and, sitting on it, stared down at the dim lights that he left on beside the bar to discourage thieves. The didn't so much illuminate the darkness as the did outline it. He had pulled off his boots and socks and tossed them into his apartment's front room. The door to it stood partly open, and his coat hung from the knob. On the table behind him, his shoulder holster with the gun in it lay near the lip next to the machete he had taken from the Viking. It really was a piece of crap. He's have to see if Willow knew how to get rid of it permanently. Robin didn't sense any bad mojo coming off it, but that didn't mean it wasn't there. Willow really was better at that sort of thing. Robin just did music and good drinks.</div><div>The fingers on his left hand hurt, as if he'd scraped them. He hadn't, and since he kept in practice, Robin knew he couple play almost all day without shredding his fingertips. They should be fine, but they weren't. Shaking his head, Robin switched the guitar so that it pointed to his right, instead. He picked up playing again after a few moments fumbling, and then sank back into his music. The instrument was strung for right-handed playing, and playing like this –left handed—meant it was upside down, with high E as the top string. He kept playing, and the fingers on this hand didn't protest.</div><div>The feeling of the night changed while he played, and so he wasn't surprised when there was a sound on the table behind him. He smiled and, checking his watch quickly, noted that he had won his mental bet.</div><div>“You know, I'm pretty sure that you don't actually need to keep your arm restrained anymore. If it was just a simply dislocation, it should have healed long since.”</div><div>“it did. But if the Pack thinks it hasn't...”</div><div>“Ah. Then when they try something, you have an ace up your sleeve. So to speak.”</div><div>“Just so.” And she stood there, saying nothing, for a long time. He could feel her hands resting on the table. They changed its responses, the way it shifted when he moved to hold his balance. Dozens of minute ways to hold himself upright on the edge of the table and railing. It was an unsteady perch. After several long moments, he felt rather than heard Bel pick up his shoulder holster. He did hear her draw the gun.</div><div>“I could shoot you now.”</div><div>“Yup, you could. Be sure to take the safety off first. That's the switch pointing to the black right now. The lever has to be pointing to the red before it will fire.”</div><div>And then there was an even longer pause.</div><div>“You turned your back on Jess this evening. She tried to kill me when Willow hurt me. Waited until he was gone, until there was no one going to intervene, and tried to kill me while I was laying there on the ground. And you were brave enough to walk away from her without even looking at her. How do you do that?”</div><div>Robin shrugged, and carried on playing.</div><div>“Talk to me! Tell me how you are so brave!”</div><div>“I'm not brave. I'm just not afraid. Of anything.”</div><div>“What's the difference?”</div><div>Robin snorted. “You know damn well what the difference is.” He started playing faster and added some long power chords. It would make him sound more dramatic. Then he stopped, and moved back to minors. Maybe he didn't want to sound dramatic.</div><div>“I have run out of fear. I had it years ago, but circumstances being what they were...no. I no longer fear. Downside, I can't be brave either. Bravery is by definition overcoming your fear, and I can't do that.”</div><div>“So if you're not afraid at all, how come you're not dead?”</div><div>“I said I'm not scared, I didn't say I was suicidal. I just can't muster any real, mortal fear. It is really not a big deal. And frankly, after I had taken down one of your little pack, it wasn't a big deal to turn my back on the rest of you. It's like any vicious animal. Hurt it until it respects you, and you don't have to worry any longer.”</div><div>“If I hadn't interfered with Jess, you'd have six inches of steel in your kidneys.”</div><div>“You were part of my guess. Of course, I thought you'd just call them back, rather than actually fighting for me. Thank you, by the way.”</div><div>“I wasn't fighting for you. But if someone's going to kill you, it's going to be me.”</div><div>“Oh, right. Totally,” Robin said. “Can you just leave my gun hanging on the inside of the door, there? Thanks. I'm going to have the machete destroyed, but it is my gun, after all.”</div><div>“I might still try to kill you.”</div><div>“If you wanted to kill me, you would have let Jess do it, and not dirtied your hands. Don't try to play me like that. I'm not your damned guitar. Refusing to clip me on some obscure point of honor sounds more like Willow's style than yours.”</div><div>“Urg. Don't compare me to him.” There was a silken sound, and Robin saw Bel return his gun to the holster. He didn't watch as she crossed the loft floor to hang it from the doorknob. He just listened to her sounds beneath the music.</div><div>“Fearless, huh? That sounds pretty useful.”</div><div>“It does, doesn't it? Personally, I wish I had a full range of emotions instead. Plus, that way I could be all brave for the ladies.”</div><div>“You're a liar.”</div><div>“Yeah. But I'm a good liar. Doesn't that make it all right?”</div><div>“Hardly. Nothing makes it right.”</div><div>“Fine then. If you want to slide past the small talk, we can do that. You're doing something insanely dangerous, and you're losing control, and it almost killed me a little over a month ago.” Robin lifted the guitar and spun himself around on the table. Now he faced the woman at its edge. “Go on. Tell me I'm wrong.”</div><div>“You shouldn't listen to everything the bird man says. He lies, too.” Bel pulled her arm out from under the belt. “This feels much better, by the way. It still twinges sometimes, though.”</div><div>“Then it's probably lingering tendon damage. Or cartilage damage. Dislocating a limb does tend to tear up the cartilage. You're probably clear to stop keeping it restrained, though. You don't want the muscle to atrophy.”</div><div>“What, are you some kind of doctor?”</div><div>Robin laughed and stood the guitar up on the floor, leaning against the railing. “Some kind, indeed. I took care of myself a lot. There were a lot of injuries that would have lead to some sharp questions. So I thought that if I was going to be patching myself up, I should be at least vaguely acquainted with the human body.”</div><div>“You're drifting. What's your problem with the construct?”</div><div>“Is that what you're calling it, 'the construct'? We call it a goddamned demon. And I think that our name is snappier, and way more accurate.”</div><div>“There's no such thing as demons,” Bel replied, as if automatically. “There are no known spiritual entities that exist explicitly as maleficent movers.”</div><div>“It sounds like you memorized that. Where did you get it, the beginner's manual for navigating the planes of reality?”</div><div>“There isn't any manual, Robin. I had to figure it out, the way I've figured everything out. Do you have any idea what its like to have an advanced text in front of you while you're utterly ignorant of the basics? I can tell you. Do you have any training in chemistry?”</div><div>Robin shook his head mutely, and then realized the in the dimness, should probably couldn't see such a minute movement. But as he opened his mouth to give her a verbal answer, she was already continuing.</div><div>“Okay, then go down to the periodicals section of the bookstore. Pick up a couple different industry magazines that are centered on chemistry. Read them, and then replicate the experiments with no equipment you can't build yourself, and no idea the hazards of fucking up except in the general way everyone knows that something going 'bang' is bad. Once you've done that, you might understand what I've had to work with. No one would teach me. Everything I know, I know from books.”</div><div>“Forgive me if I suggest that this means that you are the last person I want working wit, to use your metaphor, a bunch of chemicals that could kill us all.”</div><div>“This isn't going to kill anyone. The construct will keep me safe. Us. It will keep us safe, everyone who's in the spell. It just defends. That is its nature, it's how I cast the spell.”</div><div>Robin snorted and stretched out his legs. “Yeah, if it's intended to just defend, then I don't think that you did everything right. Remember, I was there. That field of bones probably didn't come from people who were trying to attack you. I mean, if it had, then we're talking about millions of damn people. And I mean, you can be sort of a bitch, but that a lot of people to piss off.”</div><div>Bel looked down at her fingers like a guilty child. Then shook herself, realizing what she looked like. She strode away from the table and folded her arms across the front of her coat. Only then did she speak.</div><div>“Those bones were all me.”</div><div>“What?”</div><div>Robin came to his feet and jumped down from the table, advancing on his guest. “What did you just say?”</div><div>Bel faced him and stepped back at the expression on his face. At least, that's what he thought. He wasn't sure how she could see him in this deep gloom. And it was gloom, now. Not simple darkness, but the character of the speech coming out of Bel turned the darkness into something deeper. Curdled it into a purer, more sinister form.</div><div>“I said they're mine. Don't look at me. That plain was in my mind. I haven't literally died millions of times. But everyone has a few skeletons in them like that. Everyone used to be someone. I used to be a lot of someones. What matters is that this is who I am now.”</div><div>“I don't buy that. I haven't ever emotionally killed myself, as far as I'm aware. That's what you're talking about, isn't it?”</div><div>“What? No! Don't be stupid. It's more like, well, it's like Jung.”</div><div>Robin blinked, and realized that she probably couldn't see his blankness in the dark. So he shook his head and replied. “Jung who?”</div><div>“Jung the man who invented the collective unconscious. The idea that everyone is, at some basic level, connected to everyone else.”</div><div>“Now there's a terrifying thought,” Robin said.</div><div>Bel nodded. He could see the outline of her head in the light from the bar, and what must have been gel in her hair glinted from the spikes. “That's what I thought. Which is when I started thinking about getting something to protect me from that sort of thing. He also came up with the idea of a 'shadow self'.”</div><div>“And is that what your damned demon is? All your shadow selves stuffed into a sausage case?”</div><div>“No.” Bel ran her fingers through her hair and stepped away from the edge of the table. Her coat rippled around her, and suddenly Robin saw her. Not in the dim light of the bar, or in some kind of reflected illumination from outside. But as if she were lit by some otherworldly light that shone on only her.</div><div>Only it didn't show her as she was dressed. He had seen the coat the she was wearing, and it was a dusty black thing that brushed the tops of her feet. What she wore under this eldritch light was black, yes, but it was the darkness between stars and it gleamed red at the edges. He could see most of the clothes she wore under it, as the front of this jacket swung open, and they were largely black, too. There were highlights and the edges of other colors, but there was something just...more...about them that Robin couldn't put his finger on in that flash. It was like the difference between earth black with fecundity and the same earth black from a sterilizing forest fire. Normally, Bel had nothing of growth in her. But this sight, oh she had that.</div><div>Robin didn't sit transfixed, staring at her numbly. He moved, sliding off the table and stepping slowly toward Bel. Not quickly, but a measured pace that he hoped wouldn't startle her. And as he did this, he looked to her face. The sight struck through him, and then he did stop moving.</div><div>“Beautiful.”</div><div>Bel, who took a step back as he approached, looked at him in the dimness as if he had lost his mind, raised an eyebrow.</div><div>“Did you hit your head after you left my neighborhood? Because I know you weren't saying that earlier today.”</div><div>“I, I just,” and the sight went away, and Robin found himself standing quite close to Bel, in the dark, and she hadn't hit him yet. He decided not to press his luck, and without stepping back at all, asked her. “So tell me about shadow selves? What are they, then?”</div><div>“Shadows are, um.” Here Bel paused and squeezed her eyes closed. “They're supposed to be the parts of us that we throw away when we're kids, right? Things that they don't think they should have, stuff they've decided is 'bad' and all that crap. Are you with me?”</div><div>“I think I follow you, so far.”</div><div>“So I was thinking about that, and I realized that I've been doing that for years. Something wouldn't work for me in a place. My temper, for example. So I'd bury it, I'd cut it out of myself, I'd let it wither. And so I got a 'shadow' that was my temper. And as time passed, it would fade and die.”</div><div>“And become another rotting corpse on that plain?”</div><div>“Right. Exactly. Normally, Jung said, it was only supposed to happen once, when you were a kid. But I didn't see why I couldn't do it whenever I wanted. And afterward, if I needed a temper again, I had to learn it all over, and it was always a little different. I guess it was because I was basically growing through scar tissue.”</div><div>“Scar tissue? You were cutting yourself literally?”</div><div>Bel shook her head, and Robin again wasn't sure how he saw in the low light. “Not actual physical scar tissue. Emotional. I grew a little different each time. Unique. And then when that part of me had to go...”</div><div>“Another body in the graveyard. Yeah, forgive me, but I see at least one problem with that. The first that springs to mind is that pretty soon you'd run out of damned bits to cut off. There were bones as far as the eye could see. There must have been millions of human skeletons. There's no way you could have pruned yourself like that. Hell, you wouldn't have had the time to grow new bits, no matter how you want to slice it.”</div><div>Bel was silent, and he felt rather than heard her shifting away from him.</div><div>“Look, I'm not trying to call you a liar, but it sounds a bit impossible. Also, the thought occurs to me that if you did pursue such an aggressive self-pruning crusade, I'm inclined to believe you'd be left barking mad. Just a thought.”</div><div>“Well thanks,” she said, bitingly. “For your expert opinion. I mean really, if I'd thought about it, I would have brought the whole problem to you, and you'd have solved it for me in seconds. It's just a side effect of your razor sharp intellect and incisive wit, I imagine, that you leave anyone to whom you speak feels like they're being lectured to like a fucking four-year-old, right? I'm not an idiot, you're just so much smarter than me, right?</div><div>“I mean, I've been doing this for years, but my actual experience is decidedly trumped by your imaginary experience and three months of talking to someone who wears a hobo coat and talks to birds, right?”</div><div>Robin took a step back, and Bel tried to stalk toward the fire escape without getting close to him. Biting the inside of his mouth, but betting because she hadn't shot him five minutes ago, he slid in front of her, still keeping his distance just under arm's length. There was a glint her her eye that was almost a glow. A redness that seemed to bleed from her eyes like light around the edges of a closed door. Her expression was fixed and furious. Muscles in her jaw jumped and twitched as she glowered at him. The traces of char on her face from Willow's lightning bolt did nothing to ease her expression.</div><div>“Wait, wait, easy! I apologize. I wasn't trying to sound condescending, I'm just amazed that you're so together considering what you've put yourself though.” She didn't hit him, and Robin took this to be a sign that his patter was working. “Please, stay. I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me any more. I'm just trying to understand.”</div><div>The twitching in Bel's jaw increased, and she was taking deep breaths. She looked like a woman who was psyching herself up to either run a mile or commit aggravated assault, and Robin wasn't sure which it was. The glow that seemed to come from her eyes increased, and that worried him. Centering her balance, Bel tucked her chin and stared at the floor for long moments before letting out a rasping breath.</div><div>“Apology accepted,” She said. Her hands balled into fists and relaxed twice, and then her whole body went tense and she rocked on her feet. It was as if her body had decided to spring all at once, only to have her override it a second later.</div><div>Robin lifted his hands in a conciliatory gesture. “You said you would work with me on those songs. Would this be a good time for it? I don't have anywhere to be. How about you?”</div><div>Bel took a small step back. It was more of a shuffle, really. Coming down off the balls of her feet, she looked a like a woman who was backing away from the edge of a roof, after looking down those five hundred floors and finding out how such a great depth had an attraction all its own. She shivered, and muttered something about edges. Under her breath, she started a chant, just four words that Robin couldn't make out. He hesitantly started to reach for her arm when she didn't respond to his prompting. Then her head snapped up and she took a bigger step back. Then she smiled a little, close-lipped smile and nodded.</div><div>“Sure. Sure, let's work on the songs.”</div><div>So Robin touched the rheostat on the wall and brought up the lights above the loft-level of the club. They dragged chairs from up against the walls to the table, which they left facing the great gulf of empty air. The light from the half-on bulbs was a sort of gauzy amber, and it gave everything it touched soft edges. Though such softening did little to lessen Bel's sharp visage, there was a certain effect that...Robin shook his head. His romantic side was running away with him.</div><div>Rather than focus on that thought, he reached into this hard shelled case next to the table and brought out a notebook that could, on one of its better days, be considered merely battered. Flipping it open at random, he paged around until he located the song for which he was searching. The he retrieved a mess of blank, lined paper from his case. This he pushed over to Bel, along with a pen.</div><div>“I'm calling this one Jiggered Tune, so far. All I've got is part of the refrain. 'How do I gimmick the game / how do I gimmick the game'.” His inflection kept the question marks that should rightfully have been there, according to his notes, from being in any way present. But then, Robin wasn't a singer. A fact that was painfully obvious to his companion.</div><div>Bel looked down at the scribbled out song that seemed to be crammed into the margins around the scratched-out remains of what had previously been the song. After some minutes spent silently studying the manuscript, she pulled of the blank sheets to her and uncapped the pen. In a nearly microscopically crabbed handwriting, she proceeded to transcribe each verse onto a separate sheet of paper, occasionally requesting clarification of a word from Robin.</div><div>Pointing to one line, Bel stated flatly, “I refuse to sing about seeping brains.”</div><div>Robin peered at the line, and hurriedly agreed with her. She scratched it out and wrote a quick substitution having to do with 'lonely lanes' rather than the focus of her objection.</div><div>Once she was done, Bel ordered the sheets as they would come while Robin played. They started from the top, editing the text before trying for the tune. Bel seldom asked for Robin's opinion, slashing lines and verses out or dramatically rewriting them without pause. Then she went back and put down five or ten suggestions for each line she had cut. In short order the pages she had reserved at first were filled, and she'd moved the revised stanzas. Robin found himself less often watching exactly what she was doing in favor of watching how she did it.</div><div>She didn't stick her tongue out of the side of her mouth. She didn't inspect the words dispassionately like some bloodless pastoral poet. She didn't scribble fiercely amidst a mass of alcohol and prostitutes –a trait which Robin understood to be hallmarks of both John Rochester and Charles Bukowski. Rather, Bel leaned mildly over the paper with a look of mild disapproval that was occasionally tinged with disgust. He strongly suspected that the latter expression was the result of his punctuation. But really, as long as he and his singer understood it, that was good enough. Surely?</div><div>She seemed to carry a thesaurus around in her head, and ended up making a three-column page of text out of one stanza repeated over and over with slightly different word choices in each one. She mouthed the words as she wrote, and sometime would abandon one of her modifications mid-word, moving on to the next one that she had, it seemed lined up in some sort of assembly line of literary expression.</div><div>“Why do you look like you're grading my work when you're editing?” Robin asked, after a while of sitting in near silence. His fingers brushed the strings of the guitar on the table, which hummed inaudibly.</div><div>Bel didn't look up, but she did cross out another of her own lines and, mouthing something that looked like 'vespertine' or 'vespa-time', write in another substitution.</div><div>“Bel? Anyone home?”</div><div>“I am grading it,” she said. And then there was a long silence, when Robin wasn't sure if she was going to continue. As he opened his mouth, she spoke again, with the air of someone trying to run their mouth on autopilot while their brain handles something far more important than whatever childish request you just made.</div><div>Robin paused, taken slightly aback. He tried for something to say, and found nothing that fit his situation. Noticing his mouth still open, he closed it. Then, opening his mouth again to ask how he was doing, Bel spoke again, this time with a little more focus on him and somewhat less talking-to-a-child tone of voice.</div><div>“I really like this.”</div><div>“Is that so,” he said. “It looks like you would prefer it if I burned it and started from new.”</div><div>Bel shrugged. “This is how I edit. Also your grammar is terrible. But no, I got the feeling of the song after a couple of reads. But honestly, it didn't make much of an impression on me. There was no soul. I mean okay, yeah, there was something there, but it was scattered and disconnected. So I tried to reconnect them. Building these little joined-up islands of sense out of chaos. It's practically my thing. And them make that feeling flow through the rest of the words. Here. You read them, and tell me what you think.”</div><div>So Robin read them. Tell me where the shadows end / and show me how the lies can blend / to make it all work out in the end. / Let me in on the game / please let me in on the game. He paused and flicked an eye at Bel. She was watching him intently. So he smiled at her, and turned his eyes back down to the sheets she had passed him with his revised song. It was good. It was better than good. He actually liked this one. Which was more than he could have said before he'd turned her loose on it.</div><div>Robin looked at the vocal part of music in much the same manner that he regarded the occasional drunk that showed up at the club. It was never going to be pleasant, but you gritted your teeth and tried to get through it, while all the while wishing that either one of you would burst, spontaneously, into flames. Of course, he did have a small object he could have called a 'baton' and his not-always-hypothetical drunks usually called 'painful' secreted under the bar. This was not typically of use on songwriting, however. There was something about a spring loaded billy-club that, while reassuring in the general sense, was nevertheless lacking in the creative expression department.</div><div>But Bel...she didn't seem to have any trouble expressing herself in words. That seemed slightly unfair to Robin, who had his playing to express himself. Bel got to show her personality by brutalizing people and by writing beautiful words. Beautiful, he thought. I wonder if she realized that I was talking about her when I said that. He paused, mentally. Of course she damn well did. She's violent, but she's not an idiot. Which makes her way more dangerous. Still hiding behind the pages of song, Robin tried to think of a way to smooth things back over. To get her to come back.</div><div>Finally, he set the song down on the table. He did it gently, because he wasn't sure what kind of message tossing it down would have sent, and because he wanted to be able to grab it quickly if his next words inspired some fit of rage.</div><div>“It's beautiful. More than what I had written. It all works, and...it's just what I wanted to say. Thank you.”</div><div>“Thank you for letting me rewrite it. I...don't have much occasion to write like that, anymore.”</div><div>Robin flushed and hoped that his tan and beard were enough to hide it from her, in this dim light. “You're welcome, certainly. But, would you mind singing it with me?”</div><div>“I can do that,” Bel said, and her fingers twined together under the table. All Robin could see was the shifting of her coat, drawn tighter as she fidgeted.</div><div>So Robin took down his guitar, and played through the song once on his own, and then the second time, they sang. And after they had sung, both flushed and slightly confused, Robin had paged through his song book until he found another one that needed work. And then they sang again. Robin disappeared briefly into his apartment and returned with steaming coffee. Then they got back to work on a third song. And a fourth, until a general lightening of the gloom brought them out of the fever of work, along with the sudden realization that it was almost six in the morning.</div><div>Bel found herself staring at the window behind Robin's head and blinked sleepily. She could see the brick wall of the brownstone building that flanked her host's club. Then it occurred to her that she could actually see the wall, and that no streetlight illuminated it in the normal course of the night. That meant...something, she was almost certain, though what didn't occur to her until Robin looked up from the staffs he was working on. Her songwriting had run away from her, and now he insisted that he rewrite some of the music to fit it.</div><div>“Almost sunrise. I really should sleep sometime in the next day or so.”</div><div>“What?”</div><div>Robin pointed at the window behind Bel, through which she could see the edges of the clouded sky, rather than just a dim blackness. She pushed herself to her feet, dropping the pen she had been using and spilling some pages of her current song.</div><div>“Fucker,” she muttered, going down on one knee to get the papers.</div><div>Robin took her hand on both of his, very slowly, and pulled her back upright. He left the papers on the floor. Bel found herself unable to look away from his eyes which were, she noted, a rather common shade of brown with extraordinary patterns in them. He held her eyes for some moments and then spoke haltingly.</div><div>“Is it...would I be right in assuming that you will have been missed?”</div><div>Bel's brow furrowed as if this was a non-sequitur. Then she nodded. “Yes. They'll want to know where I was. There will be more spells to do tonight.”</div><div>“So you should go, too?” And Robin was aware that he hadn't moved his hands, and neither had Bel.</div><div>“Yes,” she said. And then suited action to word. Her coat, she retrieved from the top of the chair she had been sitting in. Drawing it on, she started for the fire escape. Robin cut her off.</div><div>“Please. I can just open the front door for you.”</div><div>And after a moment, Bel nodded, and led the way to the plate glass doors. Robin turned off the security system behind the bar, and clicked the door open. Bel left without looking back, and as she did, her brain began to function like her brain again. She built a plausible lie quickly, and altered her route to take her past Recusadora square, so she could pick up the ingredients to season her lie with truth. Robin watched her go, and rubbed his hands together. He still felt her hand in his. Small and cold, he still felt it.</div><div>He turned away after Bel was out of sight. Stepping briskly to the bar, Robin reset the security system and heard the door locks snap to. He chafed his wrists walking up the stairs, and his mind was only half on his actions. Then less. Gears in him mind were spinning, and he was beginning to suspect that Bel was less simple than the Corvus Clan/Pack division suggested.</div><div>Pulling off his shirt, Robin took up the guitar he had been playing minutes before and settled on the table. Dangling his feet over the edge of the railing, he tried to lose himself in the playing. It sort of worked, and he played four songs over and over.</div><div>And in the gathering light of dawn, Robin planned. In between the intricate lines of music, wheels turned in his mind. He thought, and he played. He hoped, and he prayed. And around the image of a waifish girl who wore the scars of a woman, he built his hopes and fears into vistas of great, and terrible, beauty.</div><div></div><div>Rookeries and Music Boxes</div><div></div><div>Sometimes I think of what I left behind.</div><div>Sometimes I wonder where they are now,</div><div>Those soulful and soulless ones I put behind me.</div><div>Sometimes, I wish that I could go back,</div><div>Or that they could come forward.</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Don’t Go Home</div><div></div><div>Maple trees lined the street, worn out brown leaves clinging damply to icy stems. Winter-beaten leaves, pellucid in the blood-dipped-golden light, flailed as wind raced among the branches. Walking up the road, Rose Mason tucked her hands into the down vest she wore. A sudden cold spell had left no spare water for the usually bounteous potholes –everything was ice. Rose wore a sweater over her hooded sweatshirt, tight under her goose-down vest. As the winter chill wormed its way under her clothes, she hugged herself tightly. The apartment key, on its chain around her neck, was cold next to the silver charm Willow had given her.</div><div>When Rose turned onto her street, she found the door to her apartment building had been broken in again. She entered and climbed the creaky, antique stairs. Her pigeonhole was empty but for dust; she had the post office hold her mail, rather than trust her fellow tenants –and anyone else who was there.</div><div>Locking the door behind her, Rose put on the kettle that Kimberly had gotten for her at the Goodwill and began to putter around, turning her back on her neglected domestic chores while the water boiled. On the used, water-stained futon behind her, two large baskets of laundry stared mutely at her posterior, wrinkling. Then Rose climbed onto her bed and opened a small box that perched on the table beside it.</div><div>It was very small, only as long as her open hand. The tune it played when she opened it made her smile; it was a little plink-plunk thing. There were words that went with it, Rose only knew a few. She whispered them while gears clicked and turned.</div><div>“There was an old woman tossed up in a basket</div><div>“Seventeen times as high as the moon</div><div>And where she was going I couldn’t but ask it…”</div><div>The memories that came when the tune called were bittersweet, and while thoughts of her sister blossomed in her mind’s eye, Rose only distantly heard the kettle screaming. She wiped her eyes with the hem of her sweater.</div><div>Rose snuffled a bit while attending to the kettle, and on impulse poured herself a second cup of tea. The orange rinds she added to her mixture released their scent, and for a moment, Rose just stood breathing it in as the cups steeped. She unbent and relaxed while tracing the scars and chips decorating the surface of her mugs.</div><div>Two cups of tea was odd for her. When someone rapped at the window facing the rookery, she understood why she’d done it. Only one person would request entry through her –third floor, with nothing but a flower box—window.  </div><div>The tapping came again, and Rose crossed the room to unlatch the window. He’d been letting his hair grow out, and it brushed against his collar when he ducked into the compact room. His coat was green and frayed as usual, with scratches and discoloration on the shoulders where Huginn and Muninn had pushed their talons through. A persistent smile tugged at Willow’s lips while he spoke.</div><div>“Hello Rose. How are you tonight? May I sit?” He gestured at one of the second hand chairs pushed against the wall. When she nodded, he lifted Huginn from his shoulder –the other conspicuously free of ravens—and settled him on the arms of his chosen chair. Before he turned to face Rose, he draped his coat over a green and orange patterned recliner, a dark green cover over the russet chair.</div><div>Rose returned from the kitchen a moment later, extending her laden hands, giving him choice of tea-mugs. Willow took a mug whose picture –originally a cute, blue-eyed and white-spotted kitten—had been deformed by years of careless washing. Now, the kitten sported a low forehead thick, stocky body. Willow smiled at Rose, wrapped long fingers around the mug while she spoke.</div><div> “Hello Willow. What are you doing here?”</div><div>“Nothing in particular. I thought I might stop by to see how you were doing. Oh, I also wanted to ask if I could bring a friend of mine around, I think you two might get along.” Willow paused, looking thoughtful. “Sarah Something. I can’t remember her last name.”</div><div>“Sure. Just not tonight, okay? I’m feeling kind of down.”</div><div>Willow smiled his acquiescence. “Why are you down?”</div><div>“You know, my sister –she’s a Sarah, too—used to drink tea with me like this. It’s our mix. We were stick thin, and we used to perch like a couple of underfed crows on either side of the coffee table at home. We’d have tea and pretend we were students like mom was…” She stirred her orange-flavored tea with her index finger, offering Willow a confused smile. After a moment, her eyebrows knit again.</div><div>“She never said why she left. Never said anything to any of us. I remember the day she left. What time is it, by the way?”</div><div>Drawing a painted pocket watch from his coat, Willow clicked the enamel scene open and checked the delicate hands. Ten twenty. He closed the watch and wound it slowly before returning it to his jacket.</div><div>“We’re a third of the way through ten o’clock.” Willow’s fingers caressed the face of his mug, petting the deformed kitten’s low brow. “Can I answer any other questions for you?”</div><div></div><div>Sarah shifted her weight and felt the other woman’s fist whip by her cheekbone. A sharp right hand jab stopped the woman, and a clubbing punch to the temple put Number Nineteen down. Bouncing up from the mat, Nineteen met Sarah’s fist and went back down. Nineteen’s legs, though, scythed Sarah’s out from under her. She sprung to her feet and slid away from Sarah, waiting for her to come flying up off the mat.</div><div>She didn’t. Lying against the canvas, Sarah breathed deeply, eyes closed. Number Nineteen, her paper marker plastered on with sweat, shuffled forward and landed a solid kick high on Sarah’s ribs. Flinching, Sarah forced out a groan and curled forward around the boot. Nineteen jerked her foot free and raised it again, and Sarah opened her eyes.</div><div>The boot descended into Sarah’s hands; she spun away, twisting and jerking Nineteen’s foot down to the mat. Number Nineteen sailed over Sarah’s prone figure and thudded into the canvas. Sarah lunged upright as Nineteen regained her feet, rubber-ball swift.</div><div>Nineteen closed again and opened up with a roundhouse punch, found it slammed down. Her left cross, Sarah caught in a sticky-fingered grip.  A heavy blow forced Nineteen’s chin up, and a sharp elbow crashed into her throat.</div><div>She gasped as a hand settled on her shoulder and forced her down into Sarah’s blunt knee. When a fist lifted Number Nineteen off her feet and another bounced her off the mat, she did not get back up.</div><div>And the crowd bellowed like a great lion. It hit Sarah as she straightened up. She never heard it while she fought, but afterward it seemed like the mob wanted to devour her. “Maybe they do,” she muttered, striding to the edge of the ring. She snatched a bottle from her flunky and drank thankfully. Number Nineteen had been the last fight.</div><div>In the parking garage, she collected her winnings from the bookie. When she found her way out to the street, a figure in dark green stepped out of the shadows.</div><div>“Hey, Spooky Girl. Good night?” His arms unfolded.</div><div>Sarah stepped into them gratefully, hugging Willow back. “Not bad, Birdman. Not bad at all. The odds were eight to one against me.”</div><div>“On purpose, I suppose?” Willow Grey turned to walk down the street with her.</div><div>“Of course on purpose. It took me almost a month to build up that losing trend.” She patted her briefcase. “Made a beeswax bundle though.”</div><div>Willow smiled. “How much is that?”</div><div>“Let’s say I don’t have to worry about rent for a while.” She drummed her fingers -now encased in silver rings and claws- on the scarred leather.</div><div>“Very well, let’s say that. What are you doing for the rest of the night?”</div><div>“Oh, I thought I might go home and wash that girl’s stench off me. Maybe watch a horror flick. Or two.” She shrugged. “I may even make it to bed before dawn.”</div><div>“Nightmares again?” Willow jumped a slush-filled pothole.</div><div>“Always. Just worse. You know how it is. Anyway, I notice you broke up the dynamic duo.”</div><div>“Did I?”</div><div>“Mm. I see Muninn, but Huginn is quite absent from your coat”</div><div>“I see.” Willow ruffled Muninn’s feathers. “What makes you think their dynamism is a function of their proximity?”</div><div>“Now you’re being obtuse, Birdman.”</div><div>Willow shrugged, ran one hand down Sarah’s pile of sweaty ringlets. “I could use your help, Spooky Girl.”</div><div>“You’ve got it. I told you always, Birdman, I meant it.”</div><div>“Thank you.”</div><div>They walked for a time, their footsteps making sounds akin to that of an acorn bouncing on a stone. Tap, tap, tap, their feet went, a crow commanding entrance. The wind was fitful, and the gusts whipped at Willow’s coat. The sweat covering Sarah chilled, and she pulled her denim jacket tighter. The sliver of moon overhead did little for illumination’s sake. Only the streetlights pointed the way, and they were bubbles in the sea of night. Sarah shifted her hands to her pockets and clenched her teeth. The chattering abated and Willow, looking for stars, sighed.</div><div>“How long are we going to walk?” she forced from her lips.</div><div>Willow leaned against the door of a Starbucks. “I thought you didn’t have anything to do tonight.”</div><div>“Yeah, Will, and that includes freezing,” her hands shook when she held them out, “and that is the activity in which I am currently engaged.”</div><div>Willow frowned. “You do have a point.” He grasped the door handle. “Let’s get you something warm to drink.”</div><div>“They’re closed, Birdman, and I’m hungry too.” She jerked a tremor-wracked arm. “My apartment isn’t that far away. And isn’t your new place somewhere on High Street?”</div><div>Smiling again, Willow pulled open the door. “Looks like someone forgot to lock up. And judging by that smell, they left a burner on.” He took hold of her sleeve, drawing her after him. “Come on, if the pot boils dry the night crew will be in trouble.”</div><div>Inside, they felt like reverse car engines, giving up their chill reluctantly, releasing pings and groans as their environment transfigured them. Willow hung his coat on a peg near the door, next to a thick woolen jacket that was black and nearly as long as his. Sarah wandered through the deserted Starbucks like an animal: lost in the darkness and prowling for something to scavenge.</div><div>Briskly, Willow walked behind the counter, rummaging among the implements of coffee worship. When he had produced two mugs, he filled them and retired to a table near the wall. Sarah returned from running her hands under hot water, and he passed her one of the oversized containers.</div><div>“You know, if your hands are very cold, it could be dangerous to run your hands under water like that.” Willow stepped out from the back room.</div><div>“What are you, Birdman, my mother?” Sarah shook her head. “No, I know. I’ll be fine.”</div><div>“Very well. It turns out they had cocoa on, not coffee.”</div><div>“Hmm…Oh, what time is it?” Sarah blew on her hands, rubbing silver across silver; it sounded like coins being counted.</div><div>Willow opened it pocket watch. “ten twenty-two. Why?” He replaced the painted bit of clockwork.</div><div>“Nothing, I just like to know. Enjoying your cocoa?”</div><div>“Why yes. Though it's no coffee: I wasn’t sure you would like it.”</div><div>“I like cocoa better anyway.” She wrapped long, silver encased fingers around the mug. “It’s not so bitter, and the sludge in the bottom is the best part.”</div><div></div><div>Rose checked the clock as she refilled their cup. Dropping a bag into each mug, Rose called out to Willow.</div><div>“Do you have anything to do tonight? It’s quarter past eleven, so if you’ve promised to make an appearance at a rent party or anything, you’re going to miss it.”</div><div>“I’ve no plans but that concern you this evening, Rose.” Willow followed her into the tiled area that passed for a kitchen. “Is this your subtle way of telling me that you do have plans? Should I be leaving?”</div><div>“No, I was just making sure I wasn’t keeping you.” She checked the clock again. Willow noticed and leaned forward from the counter, poking her in the arm.</div><div>“You’ve checked the time seven times in the past fifty-five minutes. Are you sure you’re not waiting for something?”</div><div>“Sorry,” Rose shook her head, then swiped one hand through her loose curls to clear her eyes. “It’s just a habit I picked up from my sister. She was always obsessed with time. Our parents –and my brother, come to think of it—were big flakes, and she ended up keeping time for the entire family.”</div><div>“Ah. That reminds me of someone I know. She’s never late to her boxing matches.” Willow held out his hand out for the mug of steeping tea. “Do you know why your sister left?”</div><div>“What? Oh… No, she never said. The people from the junkyard were going to take her away, she said. I thought she was kidding. That was a craptacular segue, by the way.”</div><div>“Yes, I know. But it was still bothering you. So, ‘kids from the junkyard’?”</div><div>“Yeah,” Rose walked back to her chair and sat, cocking one leg over the arm. “But they weren’t kids. They had their own big van. I knew they made the offer, ‘cause Sarah came home and said they’d take both of us if we wanted to go.”</div><div>“Did you want to go?” Willow stirred his tea, face blank while his fingers dipped into the hot water.</div><div>“It doesn’t really matter. Let’s talk about something else now.”</div><div>Willow nodded and smiled. “Of course. How are you dealing with Bel and her associates?”</div><div>“They leave me alone now.” Rose touched the chain that held her key and Willow’s pendant. “What did you do to make them so afraid?”</div><div>“I didn't hurt them, if that is what you’re thinking. But when they try and hurt my friends… it goes poorly for them. The Corvus Clan looks after its own, when all’s said and done.” He held out his cup for Huginn, who tasted the tea.</div><div>“Charmingly cryptic, Willow. Really, what have you done to scare them?”</div><div>“Not a thing. I haven’t laid so much as a finger on any of them.” Huginn hopped onto the chair-back and flapped his wings, the lame right one fluttering gamely.</div><div>Rose stared at Willow, suspicious. She hooked the hair out of her face with one hand. “Never mind. I’d like you to listen to something.” She stood walked to her room, returning with the music box.</div><div>“This is… It used to belong to my sister, before she left. Mom sang to us at night.” Rose opened the box, wound it to let the plinky-plunky melody begin again. “She stopped when Sarah left. Do you know the tune?”</div><div>Willow listened through the length of the piece, eyes closed. When Rose closed the lid, cutting off a second repetition, he smiled slightly. Huginn flapped his wings and cawed; pulling at Willow’s hair. He lifted the bird and settled him on his shoulder. “I know the tune. Play it again.</div><div>“There was an old woman tossed up in a basket</div><div>Seventeen times as high as the moon</div><div>And where she was going I couldn’t but ask it</div><div>For in one hand she carried a broom</div><div>'Old woman, old woman, old woman,' said I,</div><div>'Whither, oh whither, oh whither so high?'</div><div>'To sweep the cobwebs off the sky.'</div><div>'May I go with you?'</div><div>'Aye, by and by.'”</div><div>Willow smiled again, settling Huginn back on the chair. When he opened his eyes, something strange glinted in them. “Oh, aye. By and by.”</div><div></div><div>Sarah hooked her loosely curled black hair back from her face. “Where are we going, Birdman?”</div><div>Willow smiled into the frigid air. “Are you enjoying your cocoa refill?”</div><div>Sipping at her fifth large cup of cocoa, Sarah nodded grudgingly. “It is delicious. But don’t think you can distract me with delightful chocolate references. Are we going to your house? Mine is behind us by like five blocks.”</div><div>“My house is in this direction, yes.”</div><div>“But what? Birdman, don’t try to evade the question.”</div><div>Willow bowed to her over his cocoa.</div><div>“You’ve found me out, Sarah. I’m taking us to a new friend’s home. She lives on Water Street.”</div><div>“What? Does she have any idea how dangerous Water Street is? That’s practically Bel’s front porch.”</div><div>“Oh my, yes. That’s how we met. Jessica was being belligerent, and I… dealt with it. The woman seemed like the sort who would do well with us.” Willow folded his fingers together. “She’s nineteen, if I’m not mistaken, and with a temperament that the Corvae are uniquely appreciative of. It doesn’t hurt that she took an apartment next to a rookery.”</div><div>“Did she, now? You’ve given her a token?”</div><div>Willow nodded. “Yes. She’s family. Do you mind stopping by? She’ll be glad to meet you, I’m sure. Thus far, she only knows Kimberly and me.”</div><div>“No problem, Willow.”</div><div>He nodded, whistling into the wind quietly. Sarah stopped and turned to him. “Where did you learn that tune?”</div><div>He spread his hands, jostling Muninn, who flapped his wings and took hold of Willow’s hair to steady himself. “I picked it up somewhere. It’s a children’s rhyme. Do you know it?”</div><div>Sarah shook her head. “I used to have a music box. It played that tune. I never learned the words. What time is it?”</div><div>Checking his watch, Willow resumed walking. “It’s quarter past eleven. Your horror movies calling to you?”</div><div>“Not really. Besides, I want to meet this friend. What’s her name?”</div><div>Willow smiled and laced his fingers together. “I’m sure she’d rather introduce herself.”</div><div>Muninn cawed.</div><div></div><div>Willow laughed. “Yes, I know it. My grandmother taught it to me. A nonsense rhyme from very many years ago.”</div><div>Rose was silent. Huginn fluttered to the carpet, waddling toward the tiled floor.</div><div>“I’m going to wash my cup.” Then, as Rose strained to see the clock, he said from the kitchen, “eleven-thirty.”</div><div>“Thanks. Sorry, I get on some people’s nerves.”</div><div>Willow smiled. “It could be something worse. Wanting to know the time isn’t that bad, especially if you learned it from Sarah. It’s an endearing trait.”</div><div>“You seem rather familiar with her, for not having met my sister. My Serrie.” Rose’s eyes were hard on Willow. He leaned on the half-wall between the living area and the kitchen, steepling his fingers and smiling into her flat gaze. His own eyes were dark, obscured by hair. On his shoulder somehow, Huginn fluttered his wings, trying for full extension. Black eyes glinted strangely as he cocked his head. He cawed, echoing in the small apartment.</div><div>“Perhaps I am. In the meantime, you should answer the door.” One finger extended, pointing at the old wooden portal, closed with three locks.</div><div>“What?”</div><div>“Five.”</div><div>Willow, don’t play games with me.” Her face flushed. Four.</div><div>“But I like games. Three.”</div><div>She stamped her foot. “This isn’t funny, Willow!” Two.</div><div>“No it isn’t, Rose. One.”</div><div>“Who’s supposed to be out there?” She threw up her hands and strode to the door, pulling at the locks. And…</div><div>“Find out. Action.”</div><div>Bam! Bam! Ba-</div><div></div><div>The door jerked open as Sarah’s third blow began to fall, pulling her up short as she found herself confronted with an angry, red-haired woman. A strangely familiar redheaded woman. Sarah was very conscious of swallowing, and of her stomach, for some reason. The hot chocolate was still very warm in her belly, and she hoped that it wasn’t coming up to say hello, because Sarah could feel something welling up in her throat, as light as butterflies and as controllable as gravity. Her legs were wet. Sarah looked down at the broken crockery. Pieces of stoneware from two different cups littered the ground. Sarah’s legs were spattered with some amber liquid and her own cocoa. So were her sister’s. She looked up and felt something in her eye. She spoke, almost under her breath.</div><div>“Rose?”</div><div>Rose nodded. Neither she nor Sarah felt Willow give them a push, but suddenly they were holding each other tightly enough that Sarah whimpered. “I need those ribs later, Rose.”</div><div>Willow stepped inside, carefully around Sarah and Rose, and stood before the chair nearest the window, its white upholstery lambent under the overhead light. He settled the birds, first Huginn, then Muninn, on its arms.</div><div>“May I sit? I believe this will take some time.”</div><div></div><div>“What time is it?” Rose snuffled from the floor. Sarah twisted in her sister’s arms, looking around, when Willow spoke.</div><div>“Two twenty-one. Well after midnight.”</div><div>Sarah stopped twisting and took a new grip on her sister’s shoulders. Rose snuffled and reached for the box of tissue Willow had provided. Used, tear-stained tissues lay in great profusion about the kneeling sisters, like the sclera of a great eye. With Sarah’s black clothes and Rose’s baggy green ones, they formed a half and half iris; their hair mixed into a pupil, black, shot with blood. As her tears cleared, Sarah focused on Willow more clearly. Cried-out as she was, anger was always a viable second option.</div><div>“You planned this, Birdman.” Sarah’s voice was husky yet. Her tears were not as spent as she would have liked.</div><div>“Oh, aye.”</div><div>Rose and Sarah looked at Willow, who stood above them. Hair fell in his face, but they could still see his eyes, glinting darkly like those of the ravens perched on his shoulders. A smile flickered about his lips, and Willow laid one hand on Sarah’s ebon hair. “Bye.”</div><div>He cupped Rose’s chin, “and bye.”</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Times of Trouble</div><div></div><div>“Oh, elves are perfectly pleasant entities when they’re not actually ripping you to bits.”</div><div></div><div>-Sarah, re: elves.</div><div></div><div>The door shut with more force than was necessary but Willow, sitting in his chair in the living room, didn't move when it slammed to in its stone casement. He did shrug his shirt closed and stand, however. On the chair behind him the ravens cawed and waved their wings, but he waved them into silence without looking back. Kimberly coming in from the blustery weather with her face all red was not uncommon, but the knife-edge between her brows and the tension she carried across her shoulders was. And very disconcerting on her as well, Willow noted.</div><div>The house responded to her anger almost immediately, fire flaring up to roar its way out the chimney, and the wind chimes hung about the rafters of the house in startling profusion tinkling, as if a gale were blowing about the room. Which is might be soon, if Kimberly's face were any indication. Outside, the snowstorm screamed harder, the beàn sidhè wail of winter shaking trees and houses alike.</div><div>“What's wrong?”</div><div>“I just got back from Sarah's. You have almost no time to keep me from being very, very angry with you.”</div><div>“About what, exactly? It's hard for me to invent excuses if I don't know what I'm supposed to be sorry for.”</div><div>Kimberly flung her coat on the floor and advanced on Willow, one arm raised while the other was as rigid and straight as her back.</div><div>“You know what I'm angry about! You knew that Sarah's sister was looking for her and you did nothing! Just played them like some kind of fucking instrument! Life isn't a play, and we aren't your goddamned toys, either!”</div><div>“Ah. So it's safe to say that the period in which I can avoid your anger has passed, am I correct?</div><div>Kimberly jerked off her hat and winced when she caught hair with it. She threw that to the floor as well. “You're damn right!”</div><div>Willow folded his arms over his chest and tucked his chin down for a moment, then looked speculatively up at the ceiling. When he spoke, his tone was almost baiting. “And where, pray tell, did you get the impression that I think people are toys? Did I say something that could be interpreted as belonging to high drama?” Willow slid a foot back and shifted his weight, cocked a hip out and continued. “Maybe it was that I treated people like they don't matter—have I done that?”</div><div>Silence fell for a moment. Then Willow continued.</div><div>“Well, it's said that actions are the barometer against which a man's words may be measured and thus, either validated or found wanting. Perhaps my actions have carried with them the tenor of someone who 'plays' others as if they were instruments or toys.</div><div>“Of course, in order to compare my words to my deeds, first any individual desirous of making such a comparison would have to have both words and deeds laid out before them, like meat on a cutting board. That way, each stated intent can be held up against some sort of objective scale –to wit, what actually happened—and thereby judged.</div><div>“However, unless I have suffered some aneurism and forgotten, No one has actually asked me what my intentions were. Thus, even assuming the best case scenario, no one can have anything but one of the two factors necessary to damn or save me, as it were. If I do not assume the best case scenario, then it is entirely possible that someone who, for example, knew nothing at all of what went on could be jumping to a number of conclusions which are neither hers to jump to, nor justified when the full list of my deeds is known.  </div><div>“Now, since you are angry, I can only assume that you spoke with Sarah, because Rose doesn't have it in her right now to be angry, at least not for what you seem to be infuriated over. I'm sure she'll rage at me for that later, but that's her business, not yours and not Sarah's.</div><div>“If you want to scream at me, by all means go ahead. It won't make any difference me. I know that I was doing the right thing, and your bellowing won't change my mind. Of course, if you have any interest at all in knowing what I actually intended and what the goal for my circumspect method of reintroducing the sisters was, you could always do something utterly revolutionary. You could ask me.</div><div>“Now Kimberly, would you like to have the fight you started, or would you like to talk to me about why I have done the things that I have done? Because you can only have one of those things today.”</div><div>The sudden silence was pregnant, and Kimberly ran through half a dozen snappy replies her pride handed her, and thew them away one after the other as each reaction justified Willow's statement more than the last. After a few moments attempting to find a situation where she hadn't jumped to a conclusion and come looking for a fight, Kimberly exhaled through her nose and nodded once.</div><div>“I'd like the latter of those two options, thank you. But if your reasons aren't good enough, I'm still going to be pissed, because from where I'm sitting it looks like you're-”</div><div>“A detestable puppet master. Yes, yes I understand. I simply don't think that's what I am. Though I always did like puppets.”</div><div>“So talk to me. Tell me about Sarah. Tell me about Rose. Tell me why I shouldn't be angry.”</div><div>Willow looked somewhere to Kimberly's left, then sighed. “This is going to be a long story, or a very short one. Tell you what, I'll tell the short story first, and see if that buys me enough slack for the long version.”</div><div>“Fine.”</div><div>“I spend a lot of time traveling. Usually alone, sometimes with friends, I don't spend a lot of time with people who can't take care of themselves. Or rather, I do, but I don't cozy up to them much because they have this habit of getting hurt. I do what I have to in order to prevent that, but it can make me unpopular in some quarters.</div><div>“Sarah, for all that she was sixteen when I met her, could take care of herself. She was old for her age –but I guess you know that, knowing her now. We met in the town where she grew up. She had a sister, this little eleven year old thing that worshiped the big sister but was still young enough that the town didn't chafe her.</div><div>“It did chafe Sarah, and the way she was rubbed raw, it had been chafing for a while. If I hadn't taken her out of there, things would have gone in a bad way. Maybe words said that couldn't have been taken back. Maybe worse. I don't know and I am rather pleased that I will never have to. So Sarah and I took off cross country with a few of my friends and a big old dented up van. We've been bumming around together in this world and others ever since. And whenever I asked her if she wanted to go back, she's stared at me like I was offering her a death sentence.</div><div>“But there's something ugly brewing on the horizon. And Rose, who never forgot her sister, left her home in the middle of nowhere. Not because she was discontent with it, but to find a lost part of her family, after the rest of it finally died. She came because her sister is on the line, whether she knows it or not.</div><div>“And I had the choice of letting them find out individually, and having things maybe be to late for them, or telling Sarah and watching her fumble the whole 'reaching out' thing, or only telling her after something bad happened to Rose.</div><div>“Or I could do what I did do. I did a little scheming and just a touch of manipulation to make sure they were in the right frame of mind, and then I let their own natures do the rest. So now you and Sarah are pissed at me, and Rose is confused and grateful, and I'm just sitting at home waiting for something to blow up. And considering the way you entered the house, I think you officially count as the 'something'.”</div><div>Willow was silent for a minute, having either run out of steam or taken a moment to breath so he wouldn't pass out. After a while he said, “Well, how did I do?””</div><div>Kimberly sighed, and flopped down into a chair facing Huginn and Muninn, on Willow's old beaten up furniture. “You've bought yourself enough slack for the long version. Try to breathe this time, though. I thought you were going to collapse.”</div><div>“As upset as you were, I wasn't sure you'd have caught me,” Willow stooped to pick up her coat and hat, hanging them on the pegs near the door. “Of course, now that I've bought myself the time for the long version, this means I actually have to tell you the long version, doesn't it?”</div><div>“Yes. Very much yes. Start with the fact that you 'spend a lot of time traveling' like some American Doctor Who rip-off.”</div><div>“Oh, I love Doctor Who!” Willow paused, and pointed one finger in the air. “Have you seen the episode where he gets captured, and has to effect his escape with nothing but a quarter and a bit of thread and some gym socks? Only, I'm having trouble remember which Doctor it was. The eleventh?”</div><div>“You're thinking of the McGyver episode we watched last week. Talk!”</div><div>He shrugged. “I was talking. But if you meant talk about me, I suppose I can do that. “I am older than I look. To be entirely honest, I'm much older. Some of it is the affects of fairy, which seems to make people hardier, longer lived, better at recovering from illness and injury, etcetera. And some of it...um... isn't.” The floor boards under Willow, uncharacteristically, creaked when he crossed them. Sympathetic, it seemed, to his discomfort.</div><div>“I don't really know what I am. I used to think I was half-human, or half something else. But I've lived a long time, and I've traveled through a lot more than I've had any right to even in my long life. And I feel like I have been many people.” And here Willows eyes went dark, and if not hard, then impenetrable. Strange thoughts were living behind those eyes. When Kimberly looked up them she shivered a little, even knowing he cared for her. She swallowed, and spoke.</div><div>“What do you mean you've been 'many people?: You've always seemed immutable to me. How could you be anything else, anyone else?”</div><div>Willow sighed and shook his head. His open shirt moved fitfully about him as he turned suddenly before Kimberly and dropped himself into his chair. “I don't know. There are parts of me that are... sleeping, now. I'm a bit mad, I think. Sometimes I think it's more than a bit. But I used to write songs, I was a poet. I was a warrior, and a prophet. I have known what it is to take a man's life. And I've been a healer, and saved lives. I have been a sorcerer and a warlock and a magus. But that was long ago, in a different world. I'm something else now, and I won't be able to tell you what until I am something else again. Until I am gone.”</div><div>And Kimberly was quiet. For a long time, she said nothing as the warmth of Willow's house soaked into her flesh, and the words that Willow had let out soaked into her mind. The wind outside lashed the few oak leaves hanging on by pure will and stubbornness, and the coals of the fire flared from red into a white-hot heart. Willow rose to feed the fire, and when he was crouched over the flame adding sticks piece by piece to form a tall teepee, Kimberly found her voice.</div><div>“Will I ever really know you?”</div><div>“You do know me,” Willow responded instantly.</div><div>“But just this you. I mean, you say that there are all these other personalities you have...are you schizophrenic?”</div><div>“You're thinking of borderline personality disorder, MPD, disassociation and fugue states?”</div><div>Kimberly just nodded, from her chair, but Willow acted as if he had seen it regardless.</div><div>“I don't know. I don't think so.” Willow looked back at her and grinned like a little boy. “I guess we'll see, won't we?”</div><div>“Do you have to be so damn cheerful, all the time?”</div><div>“Yes,” he said. And suddenly it seemed very quiet.</div><div>“Oh.”</div><div>“Exactly. And it's not like a compulsion. I just don't see the downside so much. I can see how to turn things around. Everything has a positive somewhere. And not just gallows humor, either.”</div><div>“If you say so.”</div><div>Willow smiled very slowly, and almost sadly. “I do say so. And besides, there are worse things than a pathological need to do good.”</div><div>“Like Bel's pathological need to do evil?”</div><div>The sad smile turned into a frown. He shook his head. “She's scared. Terrified. And I'm afraid I haven't made it any better. But she scared me, waving that damned sword in your face. I almost killed her, you know. Huginn and Muninn reined me in, and I restrained myself. But she lives, and I hope she prospers enough that she won't be so afraid. Maybe then she will stop working with powers that so outstrip her own.”</div><div>“If you say so,” Kimberly said. “I don't like her. And I don't like the sound of 'powers that so outstrip her own', either. It sounds like something that has the potential to...splash.”</div><div>“I understand. But anyway, I'm supposed to be talking about Sarah and Rose, aren't I?”</div><div>Kimberly nodded, looking expectant. Willow reached out and lifted a taper from the table beside his chair. He lit it from the fire and as he sat down, sighed heavily. “This is not easy. Not in the telling, and certainly not in the hearing. And there are some things you have to know about Sarah before I begin. The first one you probably already know. Sarah is a fighter. Deep in her soul, or her spirit, or whatever, she knows who she is, and she is willing to fight to protect it. I've only known her since she was sixteen, but for these last nine years, that part of her has not changed one iota. Her warrior's spirit is as real and solid as this table,” and Willow thumped his hand down beside him.</div><div>“The second thing you should know, is that Sarah is my best friend. If she calls me, I will answer. Always. No matter what. Not many people like that. Not many can deal with the fact that if I can, I will back her to the hilt, even if it's something that I don't agree with. If I can talk her around something I don't want, or I think would hurt her, I will. But if she is bound and determined to do something, the most I can do to oppose her is stand aside while she does it. That's only happened once, and I don't think it will ever happen again.</div><div>“The last thing you should know about Sarah: I love her. Not like that, don't give me the evil eye over there,” Willow made a joking warding gesture. “No. She and I go further back than most people can go back. Nine years is a long time, especially in places where time doesn't always mean the same thing that it does here. If I could give you an objective number for how long we've been together, I would. The best I can do is tell you that she is one of the most important people in my life. And it's been a long life. I've had lovers, and friends, and lives themselves come and go. If you really want to know what it's like when I change...when part of me wakes up...talk to her about it. And before you feel too intimidated, remember that I told you she was one of the most important people in my life? Well, you are, too. So don't get too jealous.”</div><div>“And that's what I need to know about Sarah before you tell me anything else about her?”</div><div>“I think I've managed to cover it.”</div><div>“Cover it? You've more or less told me her life story, haven't you?”</div><div>“Things always look different from the inside. You should ask her if you want her life story.”</div><div>“But what's left for you to tell me? I see why you let Sarah come with you. I don't know that I agree with you, but I see where you were coming from, anyway.”</div><div>“Thank you. But there's always more to a story. Especially hers.”</div><div>Kimberly twisted her hands into the sleeves of her sweater. “I'm not sure I understand what you mean.”</div><div>Hands that moved surely to build a tiny, flammable pyramid faltered and stopped. Almost as in afterthought, Willow pulled his hands out of the fire. Then he sighed and straightened.</div><div>“It's like this,” he said to the mantlepiece. “The power of names. I can tell you someone's name. But all that does is let you know what they're called. But if they tell you their name, then you have the power of their name, because they gave it to you. That doesn't make it yours, but you understand it much better, and it has a deeper meaning because you got it from the source.”</div><div>“I guess that makes sense,” Kimberly said and sat up a bit straighter. “Do you think that I should ask Sarah about her life?”</div><div>“Of course. It's polite, and besides: she is one of my best friends. How could the two of your knowing more about each other be a bad thing?”</div><div>“Do you...do you really buy half the things that fall out of your mouth?”</div><div>Willow smiled and crossed to her. Resting his hands on her shoulders, he nodded. “Of course. I wouldn't say them otherwise. Well, unless I had a very good reason.”</div><div>“Which you might not tell me about, if you thought there was a good reason.”</div><div>“But there isn't one, right now.”</div><div>“I don't know that.”</div><div>“I believe this is known as the 'liar's dilemma', namely that after people know that the liar is a liar, they can't trust anything he says.”</div><div>“That was pretty much exactly my point, Willow.”</div><div>He nodded and stepped back so she could stand. “I know. But I'm telling you the truth.” Then he grinned, watching Kimberly hold in the comments that rose up in her mind.</div><div>“You know, it can't be healthy to hold all of that in,” he said as she walked toward the kitchen. Kimberly gave him the finger. Then, after she pushed back the curtain that led to the curiously spacious kitchen, she paused.</div><div>“Willow. You know, that painting?”</div><div>“Yes?” And there was something dark in Willow's voice, though it didn't show in his body language.</div><div>“Is there anything we can do about it?” Kimberly shrugged and fluffed her hair with the hand that wasn't holding back the curtain. “I mean, couldn't you just run in and torch it? Or steal it back?”</div><div>Willow sighed. Then he shook his head. “Not really. I might be able to get there, but, well.” He sighed again and tried to sketch the idea with his hands. “Do you know what a logarithmic curve looks like? Or maybe the sonic application of the square-cube rule?”</div><div>Kimberly snorted. “Listen closely: liberal. Arts. Major. You tell me.”</div><div>“Okay. Well, it basically goes like this: picture a graph, okay? A logarithmic curve is one that starts at a particular extreme. We'll say it starts really high and really close to zero, on the graph. That is, the closer you get to zero, the higher you get. Now, imagine that the x-axis, that's left-to-right, is distance. So the closer you are to zero, the higher your y-value –that's up and down—“</div><div>“I said liberal arts major, not kindergarten student. Pick up the pace.”</div><div>“Well, okay. The general idea is, you only really have your full power when you're using it on things close to you. The same way that how loud something is seems to drop logarithmically as you move away from it, the further you are from something you're doing direct magic on, the more energy you have to spend to do it. That's why there are rituals and things. They send the energy out like an arrow.”</div><div>“So...couldn't you just do a ritual?” Kimberly's brow scrunched up. “I mean, with the whole group to help, we ought to be able to generate a lot of power, right?” Behind her, the kitchen was dimply lit by the flickering fire. Kimberly herself was a chiaroscuro in the orange light.</div><div>Willow laughed. “Well yes. Yes, I could. The trouble is that trying to damage that painting using magic would be like trying to put out a fire by dumping lots and lots of nice, cool, gasoline on it.” He waved his hands in the air, and the fire flared, spitting sparks and ash onto the hearth.</div><div>“It would blow up, you mean?”</div><div>Willow shrugged. “Sort of,” he replied idly. “Did you know that you can extinguish fire with gas?”</div><div>“Really?”</div><div>“Yup. The actual fluid won't burn in open air. It's the fumes that ignite. The trouble with that is the same trouble we'd have using magic to destroy that painting.”</div><div>“Which is what, precisely?”</div><div>“Anyone who's tried ends up on fire, in the center of an explosion, and dead. Not necessarily in that order,” Willow added, after a moment's thought.</div><div>Leaning on the door frame, Kimberly popped her neck, and sighed. Eyes closed, she tilted her face to the ceiling.</div><div>“So, no magic.”</div><div>“Right.”</div><div>“And you can't just sneak in there and steal it because...?”</div><div>“You know that whole logarithmic-progression-of-magical-power-thing I just explained?”</div><div>“If you jump into another explanation of wizard-physics I will stab you so hard you die of it. I am not joking even a little.”</div><div>“Fine. Let's just say that it works both ways. The closer I get to it, the harder it gets to hit me. Oh, and I don't get to hit back, because if I do? That makes it stronger.”</div><div>“Is that...as bad as it sounds from over here?”</div><div>“Probably worse, to be entirely honest.”</div><div>Kimberly sighed. She crossed the kitchen in the absolute dark, and got a glass from the cupboard. Then she lifted up a trap door worked cunningly into the tiled of the floor, and withdrew a small clay urn. She lifted the stopper out and poured herself some of the cider that Willow had been keeping hidden from her. She replaced the urn, sipped from her glass, and returned to the living room.</div><div>“So what can you do, exactly?” Kimberly took a seat on the armchair nearest the fire. She perched on the edge of the cushion like some kind of oversized blackbird, sipping innocently at her drink while Willow eyeballed it. Finally, he just shook his head.</div><div>“There isn't much.”</div><div>There was a silence filled by the crackling of the fire, and the soft preening sounds of Huginn and Muninn, who were now perched on either end of the mantle. Their dark, intelligent eyes were turned on Will with an expression that, it seemed to Kimberly, was almost reproachful.</div><div>“What can you do that isn't much?”</div><div>He laughed, quietly. There was no humor in it. “I can play, I suppose. There's always that. Maybe divine intervention will do what I can't?”</div><div>And now Kimberly was sure that the expressions in the ravens' eyes –if they could be said to have expressions at all—were disapproving. The flapped their wings and croaked, and then took off. They spiraled up into the vaulted ceiling, and Muninn seemed to have few problems, despite his poorly healed wing. Their sable shapes were shining against the black, flecked stone of the vaulting.</div><div>“What sort of stone is that?” Kimberly asked, pointing to the ceiling.</div><div>“You could just touch the walls and know,” Willow replied.</div><div>“I'd rather you told me.”</div><div>“Basalt. It came from the same quarries that supplied Reynisdrangar, in Iceland. It is the very devil to carve, but I did it.”</div><div>“Would you know about devils, then?”</div><div>“Eh,” said Willow. “They aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be. If you just follow the rules, you'll be fine.”</div><div>“The rules?”</div><div>“Well, I call them the rules. Really, it's just common sense. If you're going to make a deal with the devil, you just have to make very sure to get all your terms right. It's mostly the same thing as dealing with the fey. On the other hand, the fay sometimes just mock you if you mess up a deal. Devils tend to eat you.”</div><div>“Seriously, eat you?”</div><div>“Yes. And no, they aren't devils as such. They're usually fey who have taken up the mantle of the 'devil', and some of the power that goes with it. It's a quick way to gain strength, but if you're not careful the role can devour the person playing it just as much as the people dealing with the devil. It's a high-risk profession.”</div><div>“We're drifting. What are you going to do about the painting?”</div><div>Willow shook his head and watched the birds dart about the open air of the ceiling. “There are some options that I may have to consider. I don't like many of them, and some I would really, really rather avoid. But it would be the lesser of all possible evils, provided that I ended the matter with finality.”</div><div>“You sound like some prehistoric shaman. More details, less abstract discussion of good and evil. Neither of us are philosophy students.”</div><div>“Okay. Well, the creature seems to want to take a physical form. That's got its up sides and its down sides. One benefit is that it physically exists, which means that it can run around on its own, attack indiscriminately, and feed on anything that it can get its claws on.”</div><div>“And there's a downside to being an unstoppable killing machine where?”</div><div>“In the part where it has a physical body. If it has a physical existence, then that existence can be terminated. We can kill it,” Willow clarified.</div><div>“That sounds...good.” Kimberly ventured.</div><div>“Doesn't it, though? Here's the downside: kill it while it's in a physical body, and that doesn't kill the spirit. So it just goes back to the minds where it was hatched and starts building its power again. Now, if you keep up the whole 'kill it when it gets dangerous' thing for long enough, the minds that it inhabits should, theoretically, take it with them when they die. Each spirit pulls a little piece of the demon with it into the underworld, and so forth.”</div><div>“Okay, not our best bet, but it still beats letting the thing run wild, right? And after we destroy the body, maybe it would be weak enough that we could toss the painting into a good old bonfire? No magic there, and dry canvas burns like nobody's business.”</div><div>“That might work. Trouble is, it takes a long time, and the beast isn't stupid. Suppose it manages to take control of one of the Pack members completely? If it starts inducting new members, we could be talking centuries before it's finally put down. And that if I can keep it under control that long. Riding herd on a group that big is hard. No. There are too many places for that plan to fall apart.”</div><div>Kimberly nodded. “So what else is there? Could you...I don't know, cut the demon up and stuff the component pieces back into the people they came from?”</div><div>Willow looked sharply at her, head snapping around almost a full hundred and eighty degrees. His body followed somewhat more slowly, and Willow's stare was intense as he approached her.</div><div>“Now where did that idea come from?” He asked quietly.</div><div>She shrugged. “I don't know. I mean, you said that the Pack cut themselves up to make the demon. That they poured all the worst parts of themselves into it and then added power. I just thought that if you took the power away, you might be able to sort out what belongs to whom?”</div><div>Willow shook his head slowly. “I don't think so. I thought about it, for a while. But it was almost completely integrated as a single whole when we fought it in October. And we haven't been able to do anything since. If we had been able to strike again right after that? Maybe. But if I'd pushed for it, you and I would have had to fight alone. The others are still recovering from their wounds.”</div><div>“Wounds? How do you mean? None of them were hurt when they woke up.”</div><div>“Wounds,” Willow pronounced firmly. “Those beatings and maulings and bites that they took were no less real for being mental. If anything it will be harder to heal those, since they aren't just physical. Pain in the soul can perpetuate itself. I'm trying to help them, and no one is showing any signs of permanent damage, but they are hurt.”</div><div>“And what, exactly,” Kimberly asked slowly, “are you actually doing about it? I mean physically doing. Or metaphysically doing. Whatever.”</div><div>“What I can. Most of what they need is time to adjust. The demon does its damage first by exploiting the weaknesses of the individual. Everyone has them, and the damned thing goes for them like a pig goes for truffles.”</div><div>Kimberly fluffed up her hair with one hand. It stood up like raw silk or milkweed seeds drifting from an open pod.</div><div>“But, I mean, what are you doing exactly? You know, food, visits, TLC and all that? Or are you doing any of that?”</div><div>“If you would feel better about it, we could go and find out exactly what they're doing. Charity visits, as it were.”</div><div>“I would feel better. Although,” she said. “I have to say that Leo didn't seem that bad. Are they all like that? Just some nightmares?”</div><div>Willow shook his head, and Kimberly felt sadness pull at her from somewhere deep in her belly. “So, what are their symptoms, exactly?” She said.</div><div>“It depends. Leo got off easiest, even though he wasn't the least hurt. Isabel is helping him, whether he knows it or not. So is Naomi, for that matter. Having to make sure that he can function to take care of her is probably doing him the most good now.”</div><div>She nodded. “That sort of thing does help you hang tough. Letting the little one down isn't an option.”</div><div>“Exactly. No matter how badly he is inclined to feel, he has to shove it off to one side to get the child to dance practice,” Willow paused, and said. “Or was it fencing practice? I forget. Either way, the point stands.”</div><div>“Okay, so he's doing pretty well. Are the rest going to have nightmare, or is there something different for each of them?”</div><div>“They'll all have nightmares, certainly. But as to other symptoms, well, how many flaws can a person have in their character?”</div><div>“So each case is going to be unique,” Kimberly said grimly.</div><div>“That is very much the case. They all share some similarities; reclusiveness, fear, and slight tendencies toward self-mutilation,” he stopped when he saw Kimberly staring at him, wide-eyed, with her mouth slack as a wave of outrage rushed toward it.</div><div>“Stop looking at me like that,” he said sharply. “I've done what I can to prevent it, and as far as I can tell –and I might not be as sensitive as you are, but I can tell pretty well—none of them have even picked up something to use. I'm just saying that the tendency is there, not that it's happened. They've been feeling suicidal, too. And since I've been focusing on the bug things first, some of them are slow to come around.”</div><div>“And you didn't think to tell me?” Kimberly sounded annoyed, but not as loudly as she could have been.</div><div>“What would I have told you? We'd been seeing each other what, a month? And don't forget that this was about a day or so after Bel had threatened your life again, after she had actually tried to kill you not two weeks before. It's not as if you weren't under stress, and you didn't really believe in magic, even after I brought down that lightning bolt out of a clear damn sky.”</div><div>“I remember,” Kimberly said. She stood up and took a couple of step toward the fire. Sticking her hands in her pocket, she turned back to Willow. “I don't really believe now, you know. Not really.”</div><div>“After all you've done,” and it was odd. Willow didn't seem surprised, or even phased. She couldn't tell if he was displeased, but then she usually couldn't. “After what you've watched me do, you still don't believe?”</div><div>She shook her head. “I don't believe, but I know. I mean,” she said. “I know factually that you can probably fly as well as those birds can,” she waved her hands at the ceiling. “But that doesn't change the fact that I think of...mechanical suits, and tricks of the light, and maybe that you're just really strong, to break the door frame like that.”</div><div>Willow smiled, a little. “That sounds like a lot of work. I prefer using wu-wei, and interfering as little as possible. Magic is easier...well, not easier, usually, but sometimes simpler, if that makes sense. It's simpler to magic a lock open than to smash it. And sometimes expediency rules, such as when I had to get to Leo's loft in a hurry.”</div><div>“And the door, and its frame?”</div><div>“I admit, sometimes my temper gets the better of me. If I'd been thinking I would have just passed through it. But then, I was angry, I wasn't thinking. I can't afford to do that,” he added. “If it happens again, I hope you stop me. The birds might, but then they have tempers, too. You're more reliable.”</div><div>“How do you plan on having me stop you? The last time you got pissy, you gave Leo blisters you had to magic off. It's not like I can just grab you arm, I'd get torched.”</div><div>Willow looked at the fire for a few moments, and nodded. “You are correct. So it seems that some sort of tutelage is in order, doesn't it?”</div><div>He stood, the leather in the chair creaking, and walked toward her. As he neared, the ravens dropped out of the darkness above and stooped, landing firmly on Willow's shoulders. He extended both of his hands and set them on either side of her neck, rubbing briefly before sliding them down, until his extended thumbs lay on the swell of her collar bones.</div><div>“Now you have the knack already. My house responds to you, and the birds like you. Don't think I haven't noticed the honor guard that you have flying about you all the time. So this is going to be easier for you than it might be for, say, Sarah.”</div><div>“Have you taught Sarah magic, too?” Kimberly asked. She felt that she ought to be jealous, but the sensation was at a curious remove. As if she had been meditating, and that sense of emotional calm was still with her.</div><div>“No. Not at all. I imagine she's picked up the odd trick, but this is something else entirely. Now, what I'm going to do is rather like laying the last few stones of an arch. You and the power you already posses have been laying two sides of a bridge, and I'm going to connect them. Before, you could cross it when you had to, or when you were in extremity. It would have gotten like this anyway, and the little magics you've been exposed to just by being in this house have strengthened your ability. But this will be an order of magnitude more.”</div><div>“Wait, your house makes wizards?”</div><div>“Hush. And pay attention. You should be trying to feel heat in one of your hands.”</div><div>“Which one,” Kimberly asked, closing her eyes.</div><div>“I don't know. What I'm doing, in finishing this bridge, is letting you call magic when you want. Making it so you can do it at will. But you still have to have the will. Without that, all the magical potential is useless. That reminds me, when you're drunk, or otherwise impaired, you aren't going to get much out of this. And if you can, it is almost universally more dangerous.”</div><div>“Well that stands to reason,” she said, trying to feel heat in her palms. They were both tingling, almost itchy. “I mean, when a drunk person has a strong opinion about something, it's usually because they're pissed. Angry, I mean. Otherwise they're just sort of affable or weepy or what-have-you.”</div><div>“Right. And when they do focus, it's with everything they have in them. Being all or nothing like that, they have no control. If you tried to light a cigarette with this while you were impaired, you'd probably either have no luck at all, or you'd kill everything within, oh, twenty or so feet, at this point.”</div><div>“What?” Kimberly's eyes snapped open, and the tingling in her palms increased. Was her right palm itching more? “Are you telling me that you could nuke our fucking house if you wanted?”</div><div>“Me? I could probably sterilize this entire neighborhood without undue effort. And if I felt the need to exert myself, probably the neighborhoods on any given side of us, as well. I was just talking about you.”</div><div>“Okay...maybe we shouldn't do this. It sounds kind of dangerous.” Kimberly was uncertain, and it came through in her voice.</div><div>“Intensely,” Willow murmured. “But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't trust you implicitly. Besides, the birds agree and I need the help.”</div><div>“What? You just told me that you could torch this friggin' quarter of this city! Easily! What the hell do you need my little bitty 'explode a few houses or something' power –which, by the way, I don't have—for?” She reached to push Willow's hands off, but it was like trying to push stone out of the way. He didn't push back but, like the walls of a cave or the face of a cliff, he wasn't going anywhere, either. When she tried to step back, the ravens croaked and all their feathers stood on end, She kept trying, and they jumped down Willow's arms to land on hers, pinning them to Willow's elbows.</div><div>She could have shaken them loose, but there was a little voice in the back of her mind that as much as she didn't like the idea of having that much power, she really didn't want to know what would happen if she upset Willow's concentration and pissed off the birds at the same time. As she was coming to this conclusion, Willow spoke again. His eyes, she saw in the orange light of the fire, were closed, as hers had been. The tingling in her palms had diminished, but as she was noticing that fact, it returned full force.</div><div>“Kimberly, as I said, I trust you. You wouldn't level pretty much anything in sight unless you really had to. Also it should occur to you that in magic, as with other things, you can't solve every problem by hitting it with a hammer. More power does not always equal more solutions. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, sometimes throwing power around makes more problems.”</div><div>Kimberly sighed, and agreed with him. “Fine. I guess. But you really should have told me before you did this.”</div><div>“Perhaps. Hmm,” his expression turned, eyes still closed, thoughtful. “I should add, though, that what you have isn't really that much power. Contrary to all indications. Destroying things is easy, and doing it in a purely physical sense means that the power you're drawing isn't going to try to stop you, like it might in other cases.”</div><div>“What the hell are you talking about? You told me that the earth objected to killing. I seem to remember you telling me that was why we had so damn much time before Bel and her Pack got their demon up and about.”</div><div>“No,” Willow shook his head. “I told you that the earth –or the dragon paths in it, or whatever you want to call it; Gaia, the Goddess, Mannuz, it doesn't matter—I said that it objected specifically to things outside of nature. Not people cooking meat or living in houses –that's inside the bounds. But...” He shook his head again. “Ripping your soul apart like that is a bad thing. It's something that nothing should do, and nature objects to it in a big way. Torching a few thousand acres is just changing it from one form to another.”</div><div>“But...killing?”</div><div>“That one's stickier. Emotional pain and so on leaves a kind of karmic stain on you, but it's outside the bounds of what the Earth gets involved in. If two of your body hairs start fighting, do you do something? No: you don't even notice. Same deal.”</div><div>“What about souls, and all of that?”</div><div>“What about souls?”</div><div>“I mean, isn't there some sort of, what did you call it? A karmic stain, isn't there one for destroying a soul?”</div><div>“Oh, sure. But that's not the Earth, that's personal. Too small for her. The hair metaphor works, again. She cares as a whole, like we care about our hair. But there's not much that she actually does to, or for, us. That's up to us. It's less complicated this way.”</div><div>“But...doesn't it get lonely? Knowing that she's there, but isn't doing anything?”</div><div>“She's there, and I know she cares. For the rest, imagine that your literal mother was breathing down your neck. Forever.”</div><div>“...oh. Oh, I see.”</div><div>Willow nodded. “Yeah. Like I said. Simpler. Now focus, we don't have all night, if you want to be out and visiting at any reasonable hour. Which hand?”</div><div></div><div>It was surprisingly few hours later when the door to Annie's tenement blew open under a strangely direct gust of wind, admitting a screaming gale, flurries of snow, and two ravens gliding side by side. The door slammed shut as the ravens alighted on a bannister that looked as if it could just about bear their weight and not an ounce more. The snow that had come in with them settled to the ground. It didn't melt, as these bottom floors were as freezing as those outside. Some moments later, Kimberly and Willow stumbled in the doorway. Or rather she stumbled, and Willow caught her. The snow blew in after them, as well, until Willow threw his shoulder against the stiff hinges of  the door. He shifted his eyes to the ravens.</div><div>“You could have held it open at least, you know.” He wore the same clothing he had been in earlier, with the addition of socks, boots, and a sweater. His coat blew loose around him as the wind finally died in the lonely lobby. Kimberly was red-faced, her nose running freely, though she wore the same heavy winter clothes that she had been sporting when she came in to berate her lover.</div><div>“It wasn't nearly that bad when I came in. The weather service didn't say anything about this storm.”</div><div>Willow looked at her askance. “Why didn't you ask me? I could have told you this was coming days ago.”</div><div>“You know,” she said, panting as she pushed herself upright against a wall of broken pigeon-hole style mailboxes. “Sometimes I do want to be independent. I'm not some shrinking violet or blushing maiden who can't do for herself. Why should I depend on you for everything?”</div><div>“No reason,” Willow replied, starting up the stairs. He clicked on a flashlight as he went up. The streetlights made it through the outside door, but this was an unlighted stairwell, and it was tall. Darker than the inside of a suit of armor, Willow thought. While it's got someone in it. Then he said, to Kimberly behind him. “I mean, unless you want accurate weather forecasts.” He shrugged.</div><div>Kimberly grumbled and clicked on her own flashlight. Muttering something to the effect of 'damned smug boyfriends, especially damned smug wizard boyfriends', she climbed the stairs after him, careful to step around the tread that she had smashed through on her way up the first time she had traversed these stairs. Annie still hadn't repaired it. But then, lots of things in the abandoned building needed repair, and Annie was a sort of 'from the center, outward' worker. Everything withing a few floors of her own apartment was beautifully firm and secure. Kimberly wasn't quite clear on whether that would save her if the floors below her apartment collapsed before she got to them, but Annie wasn't the sort to be moved by something as petty as logic.</div><div>After some time and a precisely equal amount of trudging, they reached the top restored floor. That was, the highest floor that wasn't open to the elements. Kimberly followed Willow around the necessary turns that brought them to Annie's door. It was very obviously Annie's door, given the way it was decorated by a magpie's nest worth of shiny gimcrack. Kimberly reached for the handle, found it locked. She looked at Willow, who was staring at the wall of the apartment as if it didn't exist. Hell, Kimberly thought. Maybe for him it doesn't. She was half-convinced the only reason he'd broken up the entrance to Leo's was that he had been so angry.</div><div>“You want to do something about this?”</div><div>Willow raised an eyebrow. “Like what? Do I look like someone who carries a set of lock picks? You're the domestic goddess, and this is a domicile, contrary to all appearances. You do something about it.” He went back to staring at the wall, and rested his elbows on the rickety railing that was all that stood between him and a long, long fall.</div><div>So Kimberly tried the 'trick' he'd spent the last few hours teaching her. Reaching for energy was hard, since she'd spent the last few hours doing it. It wasn't that she had trouble getting any, but her focus kept diffusing, and then the magic would do the same thing, sublimating into the air. Her hand glowed a couple of times as her concentration faded away. The fact that she was plagued by visions of blasting the door, along with anything in that particular direction for the next ten feet into super heated vapor, didn't help her focus.</div><div>“Will you help me? I'm not like you. This shit doesn't come naturally to me. I feel frazzled enough as it is.” She slumped against the door, trying not to crush any of the paper ornaments that had been glued to it. Willow nodded and crossed to her side. He snapped his flashlight off and stuffed it into his pocket, laying his other hand over hers.</div><div>“Close your eyes,” he instructed, and as she did, Kimberly felt his other hand settle on the back of her neck. The touch of his warm palm on her freezing cold neck might have helped her, or maybe it was the aura of calm contemplation that he cultivated, that his touch spread like a virus. But when she concentrated this time, she felt heat surge up through the soles of her feet and gather in her belly. Not scalding heat, not burning flame to destroy. Just the heat of power curling in her, nascent and full inside and then trickling up to her shoulder and down her right hand into the cool steel of the door handle.</div><div>And then she could feel that, too. As if the door handle had nerves, she could feel the metal in her hand, and simultaneously and hand on the her that was in the handle. It was odd, but not unsettling. It felt rather like massaging life back into a sleeping limb. Then she felt her way –which was wrong, that wasn't what she was doing, Kimberly knew. But that was how it seemed like it should feel to her—into the lock mechanism, and the tumblers themselves. When she twisted at them, it was like moving a dead-leg, and it was as if she hadn't the leverage to turn them, until they did. One after the other they clicked up and the barrel slid around. The lock-button on the other side of the door clicked open audibly, and Kimberly tried the handle again.</div><div>It turned, and she went in quietly with Willow at her back. Kimberly jumped when he knocked loudly on the door and raised his voice.</div><div>“Annie? Are you home? We thought we saw a light and thought we'd stop in!”</div><div>“What?” Kimberly hissed at him.</div><div>“Have you ever touched someone with post-traumatic stress disorder when they didn't know you were there? Do you think that surprising someone whose mind has been abused is a great idea?” He patted her shoulder and walked deeper into the house. “Besides, knocking is better manners.”</div><div>There were sounds from deeper in the apartment, and then a figure stumbled into the dark room. When it flipped a light switch, they saw that it was indeed Annie. She was wearing lots of layers that, given the season and the large windows so poorly insulated that Kimberly could fell the cold rolling in off them, made complete sense. She was also holding a cup of some sort in her left hand, the one that wasn't still in position of the light switch's face plate. Her face remained blank for a long moment, and then she shook her head, seeming to come back to herself. She looked down at the mug she carried, and then outward. It took in the unvarnished –but level, well joined—wooden floors, which were covered in food wrappings and a variety of trash. From the debris which littered the long floors, her eyes moved to the tables that lined the wall to the right of the door, with their instruments and staff paper, and the nice stereo that had a whole table to itself. Discs were strewn across the table and the system itself. There were some on the floor near it, and cases appeared to have be laid or flung down wherever a space had been open. She winced at that.</div><div>Then her gaze shifted back to Willow and Kimberly. “It's like eleven thirty at night. What are you doing here?”</div><div>Then her gaze shifted back to Willow and Kimberly. “It's like eleven thirty at night. What are you doing here?”</div><div>Willow smiled. “We thought there was a light, and since we were out anyway, thought we'd stop by.”</div><div>“Oh. Okay.” Annie looked out the windows, tugging a dark shawl from the back of her couch and pulling it tight around her shoulders. “It's a fucking blizzard out there. Why were you walking about at this time of night, in terrible weather. If you took a wrong turn, you could die in an alley. Hell,” she laughed, looking inward. “In this city, you could die if you took a wrong turn, weather or no.” And then she lapsed into silence, staring at some internal landscape. Some haunted look in her eyes told Kimberly what that landscape was.</div><div>“Annie? Snap out of it,” she said. Taking a few swift steps, she crossed to the woman's side quickly enough to catch the cup that fell from her right hand before it hit the floor. The liquid it held—coffee—splashed all over the floor. Kimberly rested a hand on Annie's arm, and the woman twitched violently and pulled away.</div><div>“What—shit. Sorry. How long did it last?” her voice was still far away, but it seemed like she was still in touch.</div><div>“Not long,” Kimberly assured her, leading her to the couch. They sat, and Willow lurked in the shadows. He seemed to blend in until it was all Kimberly could do to see his outline in the grayed-out light that the fluorescent light gave.</div><div>“How have you been, Annie? Since the dream.”</div><div>“I...” She halted, and pulled the shawl closer to herself. “Nightmares. Willow came around to tell me the dream was real, but I already knew that. Nightmares, and episodes. Like that, or worse. Sometimes I flash back. But mostly I just can't get warm. And I have scars. On my shoulder, where it bit me. Those are always cold. It's like having icicles in my body.”</div><div>Kimberly shot Willow a pleading look. When he did nothing she turned, still sitting, to face Annie. The woman was rubbing her hands together and when Kimberly took them, they were cold as ice. But they didn't take her intrusion amiss, and grabbed at her warm fingers quickly. Kimberly held Annie's hands between her own and rubbed them roughly, as if she were trying to massage life back into a numb limb.</div><div>“Annie. Can I see the scars? Maybe I can do something about them. At least I can try.” Now the look she shot Willow was less pleading and more reproachful. His face slid from sympathetic to impassive, and he left the shadows to bend down next to his lover. He whispered in her ear gently enough to tickle. “Do not try to use magic on them. It won't do any good and you are not experienced enough to work with biological systems, even if you have a flair for it.”</div><div>But he sat on the other side of Annie, and set his hands on her shoulders. “It's okay, little wren. Kimberly is good with deep pains. And she's not going to do anything to hurt you. I promise.”</div><div>Annie's smile was like a child's smile. It welled up out of her and she leaned against Willow, burrowing her head in the collar of his coat. Huginn sidled higher up on Willow's coat to get out of the way of her careless movement.</div><div>“You smell like winter and fire. Like great big fires in great big hearths.” Her eyes were closed, but she seemed to relax a little, like an enormous spring unkinking bit by bit. “Like the first days of February when it's so cold outside, but with a sun, so there's a shine on the snow but the wind is blowing across your skin like a smoking brand. Like a white-hot iron that's burning the air after you take it out of the fire. Little sparks jumping off and...”</div><div>She faded away, and Willow stroked her hair as she went. His hand slid down across the top of her hair, and on the next pass his fingers dig down a little, sliding through hair that was yellow like wheat or straw. It was short, and coarse, and he worked his way through it until his fingers were massaging Annie's scalp. Then his fingers stilled, and his face assumed a far away expression. Feeling alone with Annie and Willow gone, probably into the same place in Annie's head, Kimberly folded her arms, watching the pair in the unshrinking light that Annie had left on.</div><div>And then they both came back. It wasn't all at once, but Kimberly felt, abruptly, that she wasn't a person sitting next to two breathing statues anymore. Willow spoke first, his voice a low purr.</div><div>“You're feeling better than you were a few day ago. Have you been thinking about your niece again?”</div><div>Annie nodded. “She turned three five days ago. I didn't get her anything. I mean, I bought a card, but I had a bad few days and...anyway, I didn't send it. It's kind of late now.”</div><div>Willow shrugged. “She's three? She won't know from late cards. If it comes to it, you tell her that you mailed it on her birthday. Are you talking with your sister again?”</div><div>“No,” Annie said. “She still says that she thinks I'm a bad influence. She goes through whatever I get Faith, to make sure it's not too 'odd'. I don't know. Maybe she's right.”</div><div>“Well, does Ben makes sure that she knows how you feel?”</div><div>“Faith, or her mother?”</div><div>“Either one.”</div><div>Annie shook her head. “He tries, but she's three. When you're three, you don't understand that someone loves you but can't see you. You just know that they aren't there. I had the same problem with my mother. I hated her for years. And I can see that happening to Faith. Especially with Tempy raising her. Ben does his best but what do you want? He's not a miracle worker and mommy is always right, no matter who says different.”</div><div>Kimberly tried to catch Willow's eyes, then asked. “Tempy?”</div><div>“My significantly older sister, misnamed Temperance. Who hates to have her name shortened.”</div><div>“Is there anything that we can do for you, Annie?” Kimberly was feeling lost.</div><div>“Not unless you know how to fix me. Make me normal so that Temperance will let me see my...niece.”</div><div>Willow shook his head. “We want you just the way you are. There's not a thing wrong with you, just you trust me. You'll feel better eventually. Just be strong, and you'll make it. You have my word, whatever that's worth.”</div><div>Annie shook her head. “I don't know that there's anything you can do. I just...” She trailed off and looked into her cup. Kimberly reached out to touch her hand again, and it felt...not warm, but no longer as cold as the winter wind. Lukewarm, perhaps. Room temperature. Still searching for the words, Kimberly looked to Willow a second time. His lips pressed tight in a stressed smile. His brow descended, and then his face smoothed out as he spoke, taking Annie's attention.</div><div>“Tell you what, we'll head home, and you head to bed. I don't think you'll have any nightmares if you're as tired as you say.”</div><div>“Are you sure?”</div><div>“Trust me. You'll see, as soon as your head hits the pillow, you'll check out. Wake up in maybe ten hours feeling much better.”</div><div>“If you say so...”</div><div>“I say so,” Willow said firmly, pressing his hand to her shoulder. “We'll go home and go to bed as well. And hey,” he added, pointing an admonitory finger at her.</div><div>“Hey what?”</div><div>“If you do have any bad dreams, you call me and I'll come running.”</div><div>“What, inside the dream?”</div><div>“Inside the dream,” he said. Then, when Annie laughed, he said “What? It's what my mother told me when I was little. What's the problem?”</div><div>And that was how they left. To the sound of laughter and water, as Annie filled her cup at the sink, still laughing at him. From Willow's smile, it was a good was to leave. Kimberly gave him a strange look and flicked her flashlight up to illuminate the both of them in the empty stairwell.</div><div>“Are they all like this?”</div><div>It was several moments before Willow answered, pausing in his descent. “They are all like this. Some worse, some better. But they will heal.”</div><div>“How can you justify this? They're in pain, and you told me that it was worth it.”</div><div>“It is worth it. They will heal, they will live good, long lives. And if they have to hurt in order to save the lives of everyone in this little city, then it is worth it.”</div><div>“What? Where do you get the authority to say something like that?”</div><div>Willow's jaw tightened, and the little muscles beside his mouth jumped. “I have the right to do something because I am the person who has the ability to do something.”</div><div>When Kimberly opened her mouth to dispute him, he cut her off. “And now you'll say something like 'oh, you think it's right because you have the power? You sound like Bel.'. And perhaps it is no different. I am acting to preserve life but then, she thinks that she is, as well. I'm acting unilaterally, Kimberly, because no one else can act at all.”</div><div>Willow shook his head. “I'm doing my best. And I'm not asking anything that my friends wouldn't give.”</div><div>“But why don't you ask? If you don't ask, it means you're not sure they'd say yes!”</div><div>“I am sure they would say yes. But it was an emergency, and I had to move as quickly as I could. I didn't, and still don't, for the most part, have the time to break their perception of reality and then rebuild what remains. You were almost there yourself. Sarah came to it naturally, over the course of years. Beyond that, I have to work with what I'm given. And when I'm gone, I don't want to leave a void in these people's lives. Most of them aren't like you. They don't have power. So what they would have is the ability to see a whole range of threats about which they can do nothing. Do you know what that leads to? I can show you. We can go down to Swett Street, and I can show you what that kind of thing leads to. And then you can tell me whether I'm doing the right thing.</div><div>“But don't try to tell me that I had no right. I had the responsibility, because I had the ability. And if you don't agree with that, well. You can always leave. There aren't any chains holding you to me.”</div><div>Kimberly froze, completely. “Are you leaving me?”</div><div>“No. But if you don't agree with anything I do, it seems like you're leaving me. So are you?”</div><div>“No! But...it just seems so dishonest.”</div><div>“Ahh. I forget, sometimes, how young you are. One of the unpleasant realities that comes with either age or experience, Kimberly, is that unvarnished truth will often do far more evil than a gentle lie. Come, let's go home. It's late out, and the snow won't let up soon.”</div><div>And they went out, down the stairs, and into the night. Kimberly held his arm extra tight on the way home. And it felt as if somewhere inside, there was a spring of heat, because she didn't feel the cold on their walk back the his house.</div><div></div><div>Later, in the darkness of their bed, Kimberly reached over to Willow and touched his shoulder. He was awake. He always was, when she wanted to talk to him in the night. She wasn't sure if he actually slept, or played at it to make her happy.</div><div>“Willow, how could I do magic like that? I mean, you had me doing exercises for two hours, and then I was putting my mind into a few chunks of metal. Isn't that a huge jump? It doesn't seem like it should work that way.” She trailed off awkwardly.</div><div>Rolled over onto his back, and might have turned to look at her. She couldn't actually see that well, but Kimberly just knew that a smug little smile on his face. “Three things were helping you, there. Firstly, you have a truly extraordinary gift. I wouldn't be surprised if you have done magic before without noticing. Especially with the feathered honor guard that you carry around. They don't bother with unpromising specimens. And there was the fact that you were working with the lock to a home. You've got a predisposition to be good with homes. A little hearth-goddess in you, I think.”</div><div>“What, because I'm a woman?” It came out a little snarkier than she'd intended.</div><div>“I don't know. Have I got a knack for cleaning magic because I'm a man? You've probably got it just because you've got it. Don't ask me. It's magic. There are a lot of things that are known about magic, but they aren't exactly rules.”</div><div>“Just guidelines?” She asked, making a face in the dark.</div><div>“If you like. I was going to say that it behaves how it behaves. I just work with it –I don't presume to know everything. Goodnight.”</div><div>“Wait.”</div><div>“Yes?”</div><div>“You said there were three things helping me. What was the third?”</div><div>“Ah. The three things were that you are talented, the object you were working with was an object from the home, and I,” Kimberly could almost hear his smug grin, now. “Am a very, very good teacher.” And he rolled over: falling, as far she Kimberly could tell, sound asleep.</div><div>She laid back down and draped one arm over Willow's waist. Shimmying down against the bed, she pulled the covers up and snuggled her face into his back. Soon enough, Kimberly drifted off, and was asleep.</div><div></div><div>Desperado</div><div></div><div>The light's coming my way now</div><div>and I don't know what to say.</div><div>I find myself remembering how</div><div>our bodies used to lay</div><div>side by side while we breathed peace,</div><div>and we looked into the sky.</div><div>Life around us was a feast,</div><div>while we looked for ways to die.</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, “Graveyard Lovers' Cycle”</div><div></div><div> The tree out behind Rose's Water street apartment was budding, and had a few new leaves out and shyly taking in the sun when Robin knocked on her window with his silver Corvus Brachyrhynchos. The sun was shining weakly. It put out a good effort, but it was struggling uphill against the March weather. Clouds danced all around the horizon, promising rain before evening no matter which way the wind blew. But in the meantime, the constant breeze felt good and the sun warmed what the air chilled. Robin smiled into the sky. The day felt right. Lucky.</div><div>Rose came to the window almost at once, though she looked surprised when she saw that it wasn't Willow come calling. Still, she undid the latch and slid up the sash. On one hand was a mug of something amber, smelling warm and faintly of oranges. Robin blew on his hands.</div><div>“Any chance of a cup of that for me, mein host?” Robin peered into the apartment, noting that she had rearranged the furniture. Now the two second-hand armchairs faced each other over the rough surface of a wooden packing crate at the south end of the room. There was a bathrobe laid across the crate, along with the contents of most of a filing cabinet, whose three drawers were open at the north side of the living room.</div><div>Across from Robin, a low half wall divided the living space and kitchenette. Tall cabinets with unvarnished faces lined the far side of the kitchen, ending at a door midway down the wall.</div><div>“Of course. Come on in,” Rose gestured. “I didn't really expect you. Most of my visitors knock on the door.” She grabbed the robe, a dark red one. Balling it up, she crossed to the entryway and tossed the resulting bundle of cloth down the hall to her bedroom. She took down a rose-colored silk shirt from a hook on the wall and pulled it on over the turquoise t-shirt tight over her chest. She looked almost embarrased.</div><div>“It's not just the bird man who knows how to make it to a window, you know,” Robin said as he climbed inside. There was a moment of trouble where the back of his jeans caught the bottom of the sash, but he made it into the living room without major mishap.</div><div>Rose had the kettle heating up by the time he entered the kitchen, and he kept his peace until she had set him up with a mug of tea.</div><div>“Sugar?” She asked.</div><div>“Thank you, no.” Robin sipped at the tea and savored the flavor before jumping in. “How much has Sarah told you?”</div><div>Pausing with the cup halfway to her lips, Rose's eyes flickered out and then back down to her hands. “I don't know what you mean. How much has Sarah told me about what?”</div><div>“Rose, you are a terrible liar. Willow tells Sarah either everything, or so much that doesn't make any difference.” He shrugged nervously. “I have a favor to ask of you. If she tells you what he passes on to her, then I don't have to spend too much time bringing you up to speed.”</div><div>She smiled slightly into her drink. “Assumed I'm up to speed. If you confuse me, I'll stop you. What's the favor?”</div><div>He sighed. “Bel,” and it was like he was trying to speak through a lead door. He was putting a great effort into composing his words, but nothing was making it from his mind to his mouth. Then, “she's made bad choices. But she's not a bad person. I don't want her to do something irreversible. No one's dead, no one's even permanently injured, as far as I know. She can still step back, and I want you to help me convince her to do that.”</div><div>“Hmm. You know, I don't think I've ever actually heard someone propose suicide in such a calm voice.”</div><div>“Dammit! That's what I mean! She isn't going to kill me. Hell, she's had the chance.” Robin lurched into Rose's living room and gestured widely. “Look, just because she's done some stupid things doesn't make her evil. This can still be put right, and if I can talk her into it...” He might have been biting his lip behind the beard framing his jaw. “I don't want to have to fight her. Not like that, with real lives as the wager. No matte who wins, the price would be too high.”</div><div>Rose put her cup down on the wooden arm of her second hand chair. “At least you put more than a little thought into this.”</div><div>“I'm not a child.” Robin gestured widely, with barely controlled energy. “I know the realities of the situation, but that doesn't mean that she can't be...”</div><div>“Redeemed?” suggested Rose. “Are you sure you're being completely altruistic?”</div><div>Robin shook he head. “No, it's not altruism at all. I know that I'd be getting a great chance, and I want it. But it would also keep her from finishing something that is truly horrific. How can you say that's a bad thing, regardless of the motive?”</div><div>Rose pulled her shirt tighter around her, like a second skin, and blew out a noisy sigh. “You're right. Okay. What do you want me to do?”</div><div>“She's coming tot he club tonight. I want you there.”</div><div>“We're staging an intervention? From what I've heard, she's more likely to explode than she is to listen.”</div><div>“She...” and Robin rubbed his hands together a few times. “She's not as bad as everyone says. At least she isn't with me. I wouldn't try this if I didn't think it would work. Will you help me?”</div><div>And Rose nodded. “Yes. Of course I'll help.”</div><div></div><div>It wasn't dim in the apartment above his club. Robin just left the back window open and waited for Bel to show up. Rose waited in the kitchen, out of sight. Robin wasn't sure that his visitor would stay if she saw that there was other company.</div><div>The shelves that lined the room were cluttered with songbooks and instruments, as well as a hodgepodge of other items that defied identification. Several reams of blank staff paper lurked on one shelf near at hand. A low table was near the edge of Robin's ratty red couch had a couple of abused notebooks. Dark had fallen hours ago, but he knew better than to try to anticipate Bel. She came when she came.</div><div>And then she was there, face peering impishly around the corner. Her teeth were square little pearls. Her fingers were white like bone, and nearly as thin. The smile she offered was half playful, half feral. Robin offered a genuine one of his own.</div><div>“Bel. I wasn't sure if you were going to come. You're later than normal.”</div><div>She shrugged. “I had a management issue to resolve. Everything's running like clockwork now.” Grinning, she added, “Pretty soon I won't have anything like this to take care of. Maybe then I can get you to score some of my original stuff.”</div><div>“I told you, I'll do it if you bring me some. But you don't want me on Swett street and you don't want it to leave, in case someone realizes that you're writing poetry. What am I supposed to do?”</div><div>She laughed and plopped onto the other end of the couch. Then she made a face and pulled her coat off. “If I don't take this off, I'm going to roast. How can you stand this place in the summer if it's so damnably hot in the winter?”</div><div>Robin shrugged. “It's a lovely quirk of the heating system. In the winter it's too hot, and in the summer I could keep meat in the bed and it wouldn't thaw.”</div><div>“I think I'll stick with my place. The air gets a little stale now and then, but it's not as bad as that. What have you got tonight?” She asked and reached for the topmost notebook. “We've almost cleared through this backlog, haven't we?”</div><div>Robin laid his hand on top of the notebooks before Bel could pick any up. “Just...before we start on this, there's something I've wanted to talk to you about. There's somebody in the kitchen that I was hoping you'd talk to. It's nobody you know, I think.”</div><div>All at once, Bel went tense. Her hand froze in midair, then tensed to a fist. On her face, the smile turned into a rictus and then slid off entirely. While nothing in and of itself betrayed her feelings, Robin felt he could see the coruscating fury in her eyes, like a red glow.</div><div>“You betrayed me. Set up an ambush.”</div><div>Robin tried a smile, failed, settled for: “If I'd been trying for an ambush, I probably would have invited Sarah and Leo. They have reasons to want you hurting. Instead, I invited Sarah's sister. They haven't known each other for a decade.” Truth. “Willow found out where Rose was, and took Sarah to her.” Not quite true, but it got fairly close to it.</div><div>“Is that supposed to make me feel any better about this? You're trying to trap me.”</div><div>“No!” Robin ran his hands through his hair. Suddenly he was aware that he had picked the habit from Bel, and considered aborting the movement. He decided not to, and the flicker of indecision made it look like his hand was trembling when he raised it.</div><div>“I'm not trying to trap you. The door's right there, and you can walk out if it any time. The same way you've been able to for the last six months. But I want you to stay.”</div><div>The anger turned in its course like a precocious river, changing course to suspicion. “Why? What do you want from me?”</div><div>“I want to keep you from getting hurt. I want to keep everyone from being hurt.” He raised his voice. “Rose, would you come out, please? Stay away from the door, so Bel has a clear path, okay?”</div><div>So Rose moved slowly, and she kept her hands in plain sight. She moved like she was afraid of startling an animal, and the dark anger swirling in Bel's eyes kept her moving that way. There was a predator in the room, and Rose moved like it, whether she knew it or not. Robin saw it. Bel saw it, and the light in her eyes surged before he brought her attention back to him.</div><div>“Bel, you're heading down a path that I can't follow. And it's not going to end well for you.”</div><div>“Who the hell are you to tell me that?”</div><div>“I know what you're setting yourself up against. You know what Willow can do.”</div><div>Bel sneered. “Oh, I know what he can do.” She ran her fingers through her hair. “I know very well what he can do, thank you so much Robin. Don't fucking talk to me about that raven-wearing son of a bitch.”</div><div>“But you're setting yourself up to fight him.”</div><div>“I'm setting myself up to win! Against him, or anyone!”</div><div>“This isn't winning.” Rose's voice was quiet, her hands laced together in her denim-clad lap.</div><div>“What?”</div><div>“These things that you're doing. They aren't the sort of things that people who are winning do. When you run past my house...it's like you're all animals. Like you're dogs. If that's winning,” but she shook her head. “It's not. It can't be.”</div><div>“Why not?” Bel asked. “We're strong. Why can't that be safety? That's the whole point of safety. It means you're stronger than everyone else, so they can't hurt you. Willow-the-damned-fairy can choke on it, but he can't do anything to us.”</div><div>Robin tried to catch Bel's eyes, and when he did, just restrained a shiver at the raw emotion that was churning behind them.</div><div>“I know that you're just trying to be safe. But this isn't going to do it. Willow says that the demon is going to get stronger. Stronger than you, eventually. Maybe already.”</div><div>“I am in control of the frigging thing. For all that he's so scared, he doesn't tell many people that he did the same thing, does he? These are his own fucking spells I'm using! And no-one told him to stop.”</div><div>Rose spoke up. “His wife did. Sarah told me. He was married once. And his wife tried to get him to stop. He didn't.”</div><div>Bel snorted. “And look at how well that turned out. He's powerful, he certainly has all of you to do his will, and he's pretty damn strong. I don't see what the problem is. He's just afraid of the competition. It's not like I even want to do anything with the construct. I'm just trying to be safe, not take over the world or anything.”</div><div>“It didn't turn out well for him. It got stronger, and it almost ate him.” Rose twisted her fingers around themselves. “It almost destroyed him.”</div><div>Robin shook his head. “It did. It killed him. And then he spend years trying to gather himself into one piece again. And it didn't work. He told me when he showed me some tricks,” he added, in response to Rose's stare.</div><div>“You're missing the point, both of you! I am strong! I'm not going to get overpowered, like he did. I know what I'm doing!”</div><div>Now Bel was on her feet, coat clenched in one strangling fist. Her white knuckles were whiter, and little lines of tension turned her face from expressionless to a mask of anger. She started toward the door.</div><div>“He didn't know what he was doing –and he wrote the spells.” Robin's voice was all but a whisper.</div><div>Bel slammed the door closed behind her. Robin's head sank into his hands.</div><div>Some time later Rose left quietly, pretending she didn't hear the almost silent weeping.</div><div></div><div>Of Horror and Hope</div><div></div><div>I hear you whisper in the night</div><div>and I think about my child</div><div>how it could or would have been</div><div>if you'd stayed with me a while</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, Blow Me Away</div><div></div><div>“I still want to beat the sunnuva bitch.”</div><div>“He had his own reasons for doing it that way.”</div><div>“Well what were they?” Sarah shook her head. “Kimberly,  she's my sister, and he didn't even tell me she was in the city.”</div><div>Without appearing to think about it, Kimberly reached around Sarah and adjusted the temperature on the stove so that the soup wouldn't burn. Then she shrugged and replied.</div><div>“So he didn't tell you. You're the one who left your sister in her home town and disappeared for ten years.”</div><div>“I offered to let her come. I wanted her to come.”</div><div>“She was eleven! What was she supposed to do? You told me yourself that you were sixteen and old for your age. But how many preadolescent children are ready to leave home?”</div><div>Sarah threw up her hands. “All right! You have a point. But he still didn't tell me.”</div><div>“And instead he brought you together in such a way that you two have resumed life as if the ten intervening years were nothing. No distance, no rift to be breached. That's not worth anything to you?”</div><div>“It is, but he should have told me!”</div><div>“I didn't tell you! Why aren't you pissed at me?”</div><div>Sarah threw her wooden spoon. It bounced off the cabinet, ceiling, and thumped against the tapestries she had on all the walls of her apartment.</div><div>“Damn it. I'm going to have to apologize, aren't I?”</div><div>“Hate to break it to you, kemo sabe, but it's looking like that.”</div><div>“Shouldn't you change a the gender of that title? I'm pretty sure kemo sabe is exclusively masculine. But then, I only studied Wabenaki, so I'm out of my depth.”</div><div>“I never studied any of the native American languages. All I have to go on are the old Lone Ranger radio plays.” Kimberly shrugged and tried to change the subject. “Anyway, where did you grow up? You've told me that it was in the middle of nowhere, but never got specific.”</div><div>Sarah shrugged and pursed her lips. “Oh, it was no place special. Really unspecial, in fact.”</div><div>“It's where you grew up. Doesn't that make it special?”</div><div>“Your professors are big fans of the Socratic method, aren't they? The place was called Stone Hill, and it's about twenty miles west of Bangor.”</div><div>“What was it like there?”</div><div>“Slow. There were about twenty times as many sheep as there were people, and the ratio gets a lot bigger if you add in all the other kinds of livestock on the farms.“</div><div>“Huh. Bangor, where's that? New Hampshire, Massachusetts area, right?”</div><div>“Oh, honey, that'd get you shot in the wrong part of the state. Bangor –pronounced 'bang-gore' –is about as far north as you can go in Maine and still be close to something resembling civilization. For me, it was the best substitute for a city available. I spent a lot of time there, but I left early.”</div><div>“Why?”</div><div>“I had to get with people. There just wasn't enough in Stone Hill. In Bangor. In Maine, really.”</div><div>“I think I know what you mean. There was so much to do other places, right?”</div><div>“No -yes, I guess. Kind of. But it was more than that. There's something about places like that. They suffocate you. Even when you don't want to be out, or doing something, or tearing up the town, just knowing that if you did there wouldn't be anything worth doing kills it. I spent fifteen years walking around my little farming town, feeling like my skin was two sizes too tight. Willow saved me from that.”</div><div>“You love him, don't you?”</div><div>“Yes. Completely, Sarah said without thinking, and then realized her mistake and raised both hands as if to smooth over her words. “I mean, no not like that, I would have, if he'd let me, but he never, I mean, we're just--”</div><div>Kimberly came to her rescue, though, and took Sarah by the wrists, pulling them gently down until they lay at her side.</div><div>“It's okay, hon. I know what you mean. You and he are close, and I get that. He loves you too, you know. I asked him once.”</div><div>“What? Why would you do that?”</div><div>“I was feeling jealous, and looking to start a fight. He defused the whole thing like he always does. Honestly I don't know how I stand him sometimes.”</div><div>“Why's that?”</div><div>Kimberly ran her fingers through her hair. “You know how he is. No matter what happens he has this unstoppable Zen master thing going on. I don't think I've ever heard him raise his voice.”</div><div>“I have,” Sarah said. Then she shook her head, slowly. “It's not something you want to hear.”</div><div>“Why not?”</div><div>“Sweetheart, you've seen Willow angry. That night when Bel threatened you? He was pissed in no small measure. I've seen him call down less hurt on people who had nailed his hand to a table. So what he did to Bel? That was anger. But if he's pissed enough to raise his voice, then we're on a whole other level, and nobody but nobody messes with him when he's like that. Not even Em.”</div><div>“Who's Em?”</div><div>Sarah cocked her eyebrow and then, after a moment, shook her head quickly. “Oh, sorry. You fit with us all pretty well, you know? Sometimes I forget that you're the baby of the group. Em goes back with Willow a long way. I don't mean like, a long way in fairyland time. She might even go back to the beginning.”</div><div>“What do you mean, the beginning?”</div><div>“Well everyone has one. And the way they are, I think that she might have been around for whatever it was that made Willow who he is.” Sarah shook her head and pulled her hair back, working it into a fat braid to keep it out of her eyes. “I've seen them have a whole conversation in about ten seconds. And he's never called for her and had her not show up. Ever.”</div><div>“Does he call her often?”</div><div>“Not 'called her', Kimberly. 'Called for her', as in backup. And no, he doesn't do it often. But when he does there is serious moving and shaking to be done. And she's done the same thing with him, too. When she was in over her head, or needed a situation smoothed out that she couldn't make right.”</div><div>“So what does she do? Hell, what does Willow do? I mean, I'm just getting a handle on all this magic shit that goes on here, and you folks are changing the game on me again. Are they supposed to be ...supernatural negotiators? Police? Am I dating an agent in some inter-reality CIA?”</div><div>“Calm down, hon. He's nothing like that.”</div><div>“Then what's he like? You've been with him for ten years, you tell me!”</div><div>“When he has to describe himself -when I've cornered him on it-he tells me that he's nobody special. We both know that's bulllshit, but when you get right down to it, I don't know what he is. No matter were he goes, no matter where we go, in fact, there's always something that needs...his attention. Or if not his, then somebody's. And he does it. Whatever is needful. Kinda like a preemptive member of the Red Cross. Rather than show up and try to take care of all the hurt people, he shows up in time to stop whatever does the hurt. Or at least to make it a little better.”</div><div>“And then he leaves while someone else picks up the pieces.”</div><div>“Not always. He might not do the actual picking up, but it usually goes better when he's around. Okay okay, example, right? Support my thesis.</div><div>“He's told me that he's not too big on hospitals, okay? But I've seen him walk through the recovery ward in a field hospital, five miles from the front lines, and people who were barely alive were awake and talking after he left. And I've seen him on those front lines, giving basic first aid to people who were all but dead. And instead of providing a little comfort before the end, he just walks away, to the next person or the next fox hole. But the thing is, these folks don't die. They should, but somehow they don't.”</div><div>“So he does healing magic on them. That's it, right?”</div><div>Sarah shrugged. “Maybe. Maybe not. You know what he said, when I asked him point blank? His exact words were 'Oh, I don't know too much about healing. But I've got a lot of experience living. Perhaps what they needed wasn't someone to heal them, but a couple of pointers on making it easier to live'. Seriously, is that not the most abstruse answer he could have given me?”</div><div>Kimberly kicked at a tall stool that stood against the wall. “Abstruse is Willow's stock-in-trade. I'm surprised he didn't just smile and say 'I don't know what you mean'. The man is infuriating sometimes.”</div><div>“And you're telling me I shouldn't be angry at him?”</div><div>Kimberly sighed. “I'm telling you that maybe you ought to give him a chance to explain. I talked to you and then I went charging straight home, ready to give the man all the temper I've got, just unload both barrels right in his face. And he takes it, then says maybe ten sentences to me and suddenly I'm ashamed of getting in his face and ready to admit that maybe I should have thought things out a bit more.”</div><div>“And that doesn't count as manipulative?”</div><div>“Oh, it totally does. I'm just not sure that it's really too bad. I mean, he and I got in a fight about it that night.”</div><div>“Another one?”</div><div>“I seem to be good at that lately.” Kimberly twined her fingers in her hair. “We talked about how people have been hurt because he was using them like weapons for his fight against Bel, and he told me that it was his responsibility to do it, because he could do it. The man turned my human-rights lecture on its head with fucking Spider-Man. I don't know whether to applaud, or clean his clock.”</div><div>“And this leads up to you telling me 'oh, hey he wasn't out of line screwing with you' in what way, exactly?”</div><div>“You like the results, but you've got a problem with the method?” Kimberly raised an eyebrow.</div><div>“Yes, dammit. The ends do not justify the means.”</div><div>“Normally, I'd agree.” Kimberly crossed her legs and leaned back against the counter. “I did agree, two days ago. But the fact is that he didn't hurt anyone doing what he did for you and Rose. Why is pulling off some little flimflam so very bad?”</div><div>“He hurt my feelings, and Rose has been all but bursting into tears whenever she sees me.”</div><div>“You think that's all Willow's fault, and not that whole 'haven't seen each other for ten years' thing?” Kimberly shook her head. “No, I wouldn't have bought that even when I was out of my head angry at him.”</div><div>“Well some of it's that, but...dammit,” Sarah ground her palms into her eyes. “Never mind,” and again her hands slid their way around her head, like she was trying to hold all her thoughts inside. “Can we talk about something else?”</div><div>“Will you at least talk to him? Please?”</div><div>“I can't guarantee that I won't break his skull.”</div><div>“I never asked you to. Just talk to him before you do, okay? A lot of what he said to me makes sense, in a Willow sort of way.”</div><div>“Most things do, if you talk about them long enough.”</div><div>“You've noticed that too, then. I'd almost think he was using magic to make his ideas seem sensible.” Kimberly shook her head.</div><div>Sarah laughed. “Yeah, except that thirty seconds later, he's trying to justify that Ewoks-only movie that Lucas put out in the eighties. And since that things is still terrible, you know he's not screwing with your head too much.”</div><div>“Eurgh,” Kimberly said, shuddering. “I try to forget that movie ever existed. Anyway. Give me some more juicy information about your family. Your sister is part of the crowd now, so I've got a duty to have something on her.”</div><div>“Do you now?” Sarah raised an eyebrow.</div><div>“Oh, yes. There's nothing like dirt on someone to get them to participate in embarrassing activities. And there's no dirt like family dirt.”</div><div>“Okay. I'm not really sure what to say. I haven't seen her for years.”</div><div>“Tell me about her when she was little. You've got to have some interesting anecdotes or something like that.”</div><div>“Anecdotes, huh? Well, I could tell you about the time Rose learned where all our beef came from. She stopped eating anything. If I'm remembering this right, she was eight or so at the time, and was wondering where her favorite cow had gone. After about four days, she collapsed, and I had to drive her to the hospital. Mom nor dad had been gone for almost a week. Some sort of farming subsidy or other. They had to be there to get it, I think,” she said in response to Kimberly's unasked question.</div><div>“So there we are, in the ER, and she's unconscious and I'm about twelve, and the nurse says...”</div><div></div><div>By seven in the evening it was done snowing, and the early night didn't stop the streetlights and the houselights from gleaming all over the piled drifts and the new banks that the latest storm had put up. Kimberly and Sarah were out in it, having abandoned horror movies and tapestries for an insistent wind and the cold glare of headlights as they stumbled along the sidewalk.</div><div>   Sarah stumbled less than she stalked. Moving like a long-legged wolf, she went from one solid piece of ground to the next as if there were stepping stones laid down in the street. More often than not, she caught Kimberly as the other was on her way to the ground, and bore her up.</div><div>And when the came to their destination, they pounded on the door until Robin opened up.</div><div>“The club's not open for another two hours, ladies.”</div><div>“We're not here for the club,” Sarah said. “We're here to see the man.”</div><div>“Eh? Who's that, now?”</div><div>“Willow,” Kimberly added, taking hold of the door frame. “He's in here, and we'd like to talk to him.”</div><div>“It was my impression that he was not too high in either of your good graces. Has something changed?”</div><div>“None of your damn business,” Sarah growled. Then she stiff-armed him back and stepped out of the cold.</div><div>Kimberly, who had been about to answer, came in and helped Robin up. He was rubbing his chest and giving Sarah a look that was, if not unfriendly, then at least unhappy.</div><div>“What is it about the women I meet, and getting the stuffing beaten out of me?” Robin muttered to himself.</div><div>Sarah laughed and turned, offering her hand to him. “Oh, that wasn't me beating you up. I charge extra for that.”</div><div>“Charming.”</div><div>“So where's Willow?”</div><div>Robin gestured to the loft floor. “By the way, what makes you so sure he's here?”</div><div>Kimberly opened her mouth to say, “Well, actually, he's been teaching me something that's almost magical.”</div><div>Reading her intention, Sarah cut in and all Kimberly got out was “Well, actually—“ before Sarah spoke over her.</div><div>“Note! He left a note at his house. We would have been here earlier, but his house in the opposite direction from my apartment.”</div><div>Robin nodded. “Well, he showed up about an hour ago. We've been talking about...a lot of things.”</div><div>Sarah always walked briskly, Kimberly noted as they moved toward the stairs. No matter where she was going, there was always a focused energy to her. Something about how she stood and how she moved said everything about where she was going, and how she was going to get there. Almost, Kimberly would have said that Sarah walked like a wolf, except that wolves don't always walk lightly on the ball of their feet, just ready to pounce.</div><div>They ascended the stairs and found themselves in a dimly lighted area littered with old furniture and a variety of instruments. Most of the items were pushed against the walls, to create a large, open space that focused just to the right of the landing from the stairs. There was nothing in the area, but all the chairs and instruments pointing inward as they did, it created an air of expectation. There should have been something, or someone.</div><div>Instead, there was Willow, sitting on the edge of a table and eating tea-cakes. Robin raised a hand and let it fall, sort of a low-energy hand-wave. Then he stared at the tin from which Willow was drawing the little crackery-cookies.</div><div>“What the hell are you eating? Those are about three years old, man.”</div><div>“Are they? Just about ready to be eaten then, I suspect. They're fine. Can't say anything bad about British tea technology, anyway. Three years in the tin and still ready to be eaten? I shall have to write a letter of approbation to the company. And perhaps the royal family.”</div><div>Robin sighed, and flopped down in a chair some seats away from Willow. He picked up the instrument beside in and raised his hands to the tuning pegs –it was a moment before Kimberly recognized it and labeled it a mandolin—and then started playing absently.</div><div>“So apparently the ladies got your note about coming here? Was it your intention to meet me on the street, then, and get invited back here?” His voice was quiet, but it had an edge of anger.</div><div>“Not at all. I thought that I might stop by the club to see you anyway. But meeting you while I was out and about had the advantage of not interrupting anything.” Willow shrugged, and on his shoulders, Huginn and Muninn shifted. “Nothing but my good luck, making itself felt.”</div><div>Robin looked for a moment as if he would say something hard, but after a span, he settled visibly. “Okay.” The tension went out of his shoulders and he leaned back against the dilapidated chair. “I'm sorry,” he said. “It's just...it's been tense for me. For all of us.”</div><div>“I understand. But as I said, there are some few tricks that I think you might like to know. Although when you use them, I suggest you leave that gun behind.” Willow directed a pointed glance at where Robin's shoulder-holster made a bulge in his jacket, pulled tight by his posture. At this stern examination, Robin straightened up and pulled his coat down, smoothing the lump into almost-invisibility.</div><div>“I don't wear it to hurt people, you know. It's just for self defense.”</div><div>“A shield is for defense. A gun exists solely to kill.” Willow waved a hand. “But you know my feelings, and I'll not try your patience further. I believe the ladies had something to say to either you or me.”</div><div>Sarah and Kimberly found themselves the subject of two male gazes, curious and expectant. Looking at Sarah, Kimberly spoke.</div><div>“Willow, Sarah has some things to say to you. If you don't interrupt, she might manage to get through them without hitting you. When she's done, it's your turn.” She turned to Sarah. “Did I get everything?”</div><div>“There wasn't much to get. But yeah, you were pretty accurate.” Sarah took a deep breath, and explained how she felt about Rose, and what he had done. Willow listened with a cocked head, looking for all the world like brown-haired crow staring at someone with a hotdog. He ate up her story without comment, and took an instant to collect himself when she finished. Then he opened his mouth to join in. He looked at her again, then, and asked, “is that everything, or should I hold my reply a little longer?”</div><div>Sarah shook her head mutely. Some of the anger she had carried that afternoon had risen in her telling, and her eyes were shining with wither tears or fury. Willow nodded, and looked at the floor, then the ceiling as if searching for inspiration.</div><div>“There was nothing I could do for your sister when we left. You know that as much as I do, but I'm not sure you remember how young she really was. Ten years is an age with a lot of flexibility. She could have been mature enough to act fifteen, some days, and then five years, the next. But she was young more often than she was old, Sarah, and she wasn't strong like you.”</div><div>“Rose is every bit as strong as I am, and you took me!”</div><div>“I took you because you needed it, and because you could take care of yourself. Rose needs someone to take care of in order to be strong. Had you noticed that? Even then, if she was protecting someone or something, Rose was a rock wall and as stubborn as you are. But if it was something threatening her, she just gave in. That wasn't something that would be a good trait on a lot of my journeys.”</div><div>“But why did you bring us back together, after so damn long? We could have lived out our lives happily enough. But you couldn't resist meddling, could you?”</div><div>Willow shook his head and closed his eyes. Kimberly was struck by how dark they were. They seemed to be set more deeply than she remembered. The lighting, she decided, as Willow sighed and rested his head in his hands. He spoke from that position, addressing his lap.</div><div>“Rose was going to get tied up in this regardless of what I did. She was too scared not to. Living where she did, she is a natural food source for the demon. So instead of letting her become its next meal, I gave her something to protect. And just like that, the scared young woman changed into a pissed off she-lion.”</div><div>Sarah wasn't having it, and her eyes narrowed as she spoke. “You called her here. Yours was the will and the power that brought her, and now you've bound her to this cause as surely as you have Kimberly or Leo or Annie. So don't talk to me about 'she was going to get involved anyway.' It's bullshit. You can't argue with me about it, either, because it's the truth.”</div><div>But Willow's head came up, and his eyes sought Sarah's. “No, Sarah, I didn't. She came of her own free will. I didn't coerce her, and I didn't summon her. She left. And maybe you should be learning why instead of trying to pin your anger on me. You left her, and now you're having a hard time because your sister is a stranger. And since you're angry, you don't want to deal with the fact that it might just be your own damned fault.” His eyes seemed to flash in the low light, and his back straightened like a man who found new strength while under a heavy load.</div><div>“I know that you're having a hard time with Rose, but she's under my protection, and that's the best I can give her. She is strong, and if you're going to give me shit about how I hurt her, you should look at how you hurt her, leaving and then doing nothing for the next ten years. It wasn't my responsibility, Sarah, it was yours. And if you neglected it, it's not my fault that getting to know the stranger who used to be your sister hurts. That would have happened anyway. If anything, I did what I could do help. Would you prefer it if I hadn't done anything? Would you really?</div><div>Sarah held Willow's eyes for one furious second, and then took three long steps to the railing of the loft. Her voice was quiet when she spoke, and Kimberly barely heard her. Willow seemed to have no trouble, and Robin looked intensely uncomfortable.</div><div>“I just expected her to grow up out on the Hill. And I expected her to get married there, and get old there. She's better than me. She deserved that life. I couldn't do it, but she was right for it. Now she's in danger and I can't protect her because I haven't got any magic like you do. Like Kimberly does. Hell, even the minstrel there has the fucking tricks that you've taught him. I'm just muscle, and stubborn.</div><div>“And I know what pushed my sister out of the Hill, and it wasn't right. And I can't even go back there and kill the fucker, because that wouldn't change anything. I'm not even sure how long I'm going to have my sister. If she gets hurt in this, it will be my fault for leaving. If I hadn't, she wouldn't have been involved in one of your stupid damn saving-the-known-world contrivances.”</div><div>“I don't know about the whole world,” Willow said. “There are a lot of people, and many of them would be good at fighting the demon even without training. But, this much I can say about your sister. She is strong enough to come through this unscathed, in herself. She had the same strength of character that you do. And as for what happened in Stone Hill—“</div><div>“Don't talk about it. That's private, just between us. But...you say she can come through alright?”</div><div>“If I do this right, we'll all come through this alive. Maybe even whole, if I am as good as I think I am.”</div><div>“Are you?”</div><div>“I hope so, Sarah.” Willow looked inexplicably old. The shroud of years that he carried with him thickened until it lay visibly on him like a mantle, glinting about his shoulders. He stilled to the point where he looked like a statue. Kimberly felt a chill of fear.</div><div>“ 'I hope so,' “Kimberly said. “Really doesn't sound so good, Willow. What can we do to improve those odds for her? And while we're at it, can we improve the odds for everyone?”</div><div>He started to shake his head, and then looked suddenly upward, as if he were a dog catching the scent of fox.</div><div>He started to shake his head, and then looked suddenly upward, as if he were a dog catching the scent of fox. With the air of one approaching and idea gently, so that it wouldn't startle and fly away, he changed  his shaking head to a nodding one. On his shoulders, the ravens looked as if he had just addressed them. That is to say, they faced him and cocked their heads like a human might if spoken to. They bobbed their heads in assent, and preened at his hair. He was their own clan mate, after all. Then Willow smiled a little smile.</div><div>“Maybe. Maybe yes. Yes, definitely, there is. You won't like it though, Kimberly.”</div><div>“Why,” she asked. “Is it dangerous?”</div><div>“Not exactly. But you did say you were the jealous type.”</div><div></div><div>And two hours later, they stood some distance up an alleyway protected from the sweep of wind by the brick wall at its back, and the buildings on either side. There was only one exit from the alley –it's mouth, which opened onto Jermains boulevard. On the southern side, there was a great brownstone building. To the north, the side wall of a church that had seen better days provided both marginal shelter from the wind that howled down out of the Dakotas and served as the boundary of the alley.</div><div>The brick wall that backed the alley was thick, and more strongly built than Robin had thought at first sight. It was ruinous in appearance, but when the musician surreptitiously dug at it with his fingernails, the mortar gave up none of its substance. He leaned against it and tried to find a way out of the eddy of wind that formed in the alley Willow had led them to, after collecting Leo from his apartment on short notice.</div><div>Now, Willow was doing an impression of a drunken, delirious hobo, counting stones in the wall of the church. He started from the bottom right, and moved progressively up and to the right as his muttering increased in both speed and madness.</div><div>“No, it's...early December.” He moved his hand down two stones. “Moon is waxing” Left three stones. “...but we'll have a blue moon this month.” Back one. Twice he started over completely, until he seemed satisfied with his preparations. From somewhere under his coat, Willow drew a piece of white sidewalk chalk, and scratched a door onto the side of the church. Then, taking one short step back, the man began to draw a series of circles and lines. The angles between them he measured with thumb and forefinger,  occasionally making marks to keep track of where lines would go in a moment.</div><div>After some minutes of work, he had a circle with four other, smaller circles adjoining it at points spaced evenly from each other and the wall, which the circle directly abutted. The chalk door was squarely in front of the chalk diagram on the ground. Leo stepped closer to the markings and squinted.</div><div>“Is that a summoning circle, from the Book of Solomon?”</div><div>Willow stowed the chalk away and raised an eyebrow. “Well spotted. Not quite, but you've got the general idea. You all stand in the middle and repeat after me. Then, if everyone does everything right, the odds get evened.”</div><div>“Please, tell me you aren't trying to summon something that will fight the creature on its own terms,” Robin said. “That thing is pure ugly, and something that can out-ugly it is not something I want to be involved with.”</div><div>Willow waved one hand sharply in front of himself. “No. I have no intention of fighting the construct with the same thing that was used to create it. But I do think that what we are about to call will aid us enormously.”</div><div>“What are we about to call, Willow?” Leo interjected. “Stop talking in riddles, would you? You aren't really clarifying things, and this is a matter that could use a good deal of clarity.”</div><div>“All in good time, Leo. Now, if you will each take up a station inside one of the smaller circles the is linked with the larger one. I won't actually require you to do anything, just stand in them. Oh, and look suitably impressed  when what is going to happen, happens.” Willow brushed off his hands and stepped back to admire his work. As the others took their places, he strode forward, completely disregarding the lines, and knocked on the side of the church. The first time he brought his fist down on the wall, it sounded just like that; a fist on a wall.</div><div>The second time, in addition to the fleshy slap of a hand on stone, there was a sense of resonance, of sound felt rather than heard. The third time, the fourth time, the fifth time; when Willow's hand impacted the door he had drawn, it sounded like a brass knocker on oak, and the group could feel the reverberations in their bones. It was a call going out on a deeper level than the mere knocking upon of a magical door.</div><div>Willow took his place in the vacant chalk circle, and turned slightly in order to see the door completely. As well as anything that might come through it. Kimberly strained her eyes, but could see nothing changed about the door. It was still chalk, still drawn on the wall of a church. But yet, as she looked, she could have sworn that in addition to being a wall of solid stone, it was not. That it was, in fact, a great wooden door.</div><div>“How did you do that?” She asked.</div><div>“Hush, love. It's very complex, and you don't have the background for it yet. Besides, she's coming, and she loves to be the center of attention.”</div><div>“She?”</div><div>But there was no time for outrage or jealousy. The door was opening, and Kimberly craned her neck with Robin and Leo to see what might come out of it. There was nothing. And then, there was something. Not darkness, or exactly light. But the sensation of movement in the darkness. Kimberly opened her mouth to ask a question, but encountered Willow's upraised finger, pressing against her lips. As she tried to decide if his action was something she should find cute or infuriating, there was light.</div><div>Bright, white like filled the alley, actinic and unrelenting. The trash that cluttered the pavement stood out sharply, like black and white cutout dolls in filth. The door opened inward, and there was the outline of someone. No details in that light, only the sharp-edged corners of the figure in the door. Which was then closing, then closed, then gone. And standing before the somewhat lopsided outline, in chalk, of a door, was a little girl. She was perhaps ten, and wearing a red dress, and there was a large back hanging from one shoulder. Little black buckled shoes adorned her feet, and her hair was as red as the dress itself.</div><div>"Do you always have to put this on a stone wall? They're really heavy, and I like wood better." A face peered out of the mass of red curls. Leo turned to Willow.</div><div>"You made a ten-foot door for a midget with a bad dye job?"</div><div>"I'm not a midget! I'm ten whole years old, and besides, being big like you would be boring. I'd have to work." The child shifted, and she looked even smaller than she was. The bag loomed larger, and she dropped it, as if the weight was too much for her.</div><div>Willow sank into a crouch, and his coat ballooned around him, setting along the ground like a pair of wings stretched out behind him. “If you can’t get here on your own, then you shouldn’t be here, Em. What's so much trouble about opening a stone door?”</div><div>“I will always be here.” The steel in her voice should have come from a much larger body.</div><div>“Not corporeally. It makes a difference, you know.”</div><div>“No it doesn’t. It only matters if you play by the rules.” She waved her small, flawless hand. “I never play by the rules. It’s not fun.”</div><div>“Great. Who’s up for a game of Calvinball?” Kimberly stared back at Willow and the girl. “Don’t play dumb, Willow. I caught you chortling over the comics two weeks ago.”</div><div>The girl stuck out her tongue. “I’m not ‘the girl’. I’m Marilka. “Do you like my bag? I made it. It was fun. Do you like kittens? Sometimes I meet people who don't like kittens and they all seem to hate fun, too. Do you hate fun? I don't, I love fun, it's the very best thing to do, I think. Although I like dancing, too, do you like dancing?”</div><div>Kimberly raised an eyebrow and looked at Willow through her lashes. “Is she done?” He shrugged.</div><div>“It’s hard to tell. I’ve seen her talk for thirty minutes without actually inhaling, though,” He winked at Marilka. “Generally I just go on as if she hadn‘t spoken.”</div><div>Pouting, the girl plunged a hand into her bag and rooted around. After a few moments, she pulled a large Styrofoam bat. She walked coolly to Willow and, without ceremony, struck at him twice. He stepped smoothly aside.</div><div>“Don’t hit me, Marilka. I won’t tolerate it.” He rubbed his hands together. “There's a problem.”</div><div>“Of course there is. You never call me anymore unless there's a problem.”</div><div>This stopped Willow, and he turned in his crouch, bringing himself down onto one knee to face her. “You know why that is,” he said softly. “And I would have it otherwise if I could.”</div><div>Marilka looked suddenly downcast. “I know. I know, Katushka. So why don't we go somewhere and talk about what the danger is this time, shall we?” She slapped her hands together, rubbing them in anticipation in a manner altogether out of keeping with her ten-year-old body.</div><div>Leo and Robin looked at each other, then looked at the child. They turned to Willow. “This?This is going to save us?” Robin looked like he had swallowed something, only to be told later what had actually been in it. “Really?”</div><div>“Now, Robin. You know we can only save ourselves, and hope that others make the same choice. But yes, she should be able to help. Come along to my house, and we'll tell her about what has happened. And then we'll see what she can do. Oh, Kimberly, that reminds me. Call together the clan.”</div><div>She looked startled. “What, everyone?”</div><div>“Yes, everyone. We'll need them.”</div><div>So she closed her eyes, and called her magic, and she did that thing.</div><div>The Night Before</div><div></div><div>Sometimes you need the pain</div><div>to see the truth plain.</div><div>The scars from yesterday</div><div>May show you the way.</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, Roadmarks</div><div></div><div>They passed through the airy darkness of Willow's living room and down the hall at the far end. Kimberly had walked the dimensions of the house in daylight, but she still felt that they were walking for far longer than they should have been, and when they made it to the small stone room into which the hallway spilled, the room seemed different. Then she saw the large round table in the center of the room –taking up, in fact, most of the room itself—and realized why this place seemed strange to her. This wasn't Willow's house. Or at least not the one that she saw in daylight, that she could reach by normal paths. The fact that this didn't even surprise her very much did nothing positive for her mood.</div><div>“I wish I could say that I'm entirely thrilled to meet my boyfriend's wife,” Kimberly said. “But honestly I'm not sure how to feel.”</div><div>Marilka flinched as if stung, and her body...wavered, like the air over hot pavement.</div><div>“Stop it, Kimberly. You don't know how hard it is to do what she's doing. And I have no right to call her, especially not for something like this. You certainly don't have the right to antagonize her.”</div><div>Kimberly sighed and walked to one of the plain chairs that circled the table. Laying her hands on the back, she felt carved letters on it. “I'm sorry. That wasn't called for, Willow, why does this chair have Sarah's name carved into the back of it?”</div><div>From the sound of it, in the dimness, Willow shrugged. “My own conceit, I suppose. Yours is two seats to the right.”</div><div>Surely enough, Kimberly Aurora Ainedan was carved into that chair, and she pulled it out. She didn't sit, though. Instead Kimberly leaned against the table edge.</div><div>Kimberly sighed and walked to one of the plain chairs that circled the table. Laying her hands on the back, she felt carved letters on it. “I'm sorry. That wasn't called for, Willow, why does this chair have Sarah's name carved into the back of it?”</div><div>From the sound of it, in the dimness, Willow shrugged. “My own conceit, I suppose. Yours is two seats to the right.”</div><div>Surely enough, Kimberly Aurora Ainedan was carved into that chair, and she pulled it out. She didn't sit, though. Instead Kimberly leaned against the table edge.</div><div>“Willow. What are we going to do?”</div><div>Willow smiled and pulled out his own seat. “What we will do is wait for everyone else to show up. Then Marilka and I are going to unleash our devastatingly cunning plan to protect everyone, denature the demon and save the day.”</div><div>Kimberly rested her feet in the seat of the chair. “Fine. But...tell me about Marilka? Who she is, what she is?”</div><div>Willow and Marilka shared a look, then stared at the floor. “Kimberly,” Willow said slowly. “I told you what happened when I died. Em was my wife. The one who watched over my body for so long. That's who she is.”</div><div>As Kimberly tried to draw herself into a reply, Robin and Leo broke in at the same time.</div><div>“You were dead?” Came from Leo.</div><div>“You were married?” This was Robin.</div><div>Willow nodded to both of them. “I don't like sharing the whole story, and I'm going to tell it in full in a little bit. Once everyone had arrived. So I won't repeat myself. Just let it go as it is. Yes, I have died. Yes, I have been married. But death did us part in more than the usual sense.” He and Marilka made eye contact once again, and the sadness in her ten-year-old eyes struck at Kimberly's heart. She reached for something to say.</div><div>“How is it that you were married so long ago, and she looks ten? Is it just some weird magic backward-aging thing?”</div><div>Willow laughed, and Marilka crossed to stand by Kimberly, gestured for the woman to stand. “It's just a glamor. The form amuses me for the time being. But if I felt like it,” Marilka leaned close, and somehow as her face came to where it should have brushed Kimberly's jeans, she was too tall for that. The suddenly much more adult looking redhead whispered in Kimberly's ear. “I could be more than enough competition for you.”</div><div>Stepping back, Marilka ran one hand down her body, which was wearing near-duplicates of Kimberly's own coat, shirt and jeans. Shedding the coat and tossing it onto the table, her developed body strained at the fabric of a thin t-shirt in all the right ways. She moved in close again.</div><div>“What do you think, honey? Do you want me to try and fight for my man? I am much better than you at it. And I've had a lot of experience, and I never, ever, lose.”</div><div>“That's enough!” Willow clapped his hands sharply. “Marilka, stop that at once. She doesn't know what we know. It isn't fair to do that to her. So stop it now.”</div><div>And Marilka did stop, freezing completely. Then she stepped back, head bowed. “Of course. That was boorish of me.” She pressed her lips together. “Forgive me, Kimberly. I shouldn't have hurt you. It was wrong of me.” Then she smiled and twirled on one foot. As she turned, absolutely nothing happened. But when she had finished, there was a ten-year-old girl in a sundress again. She pulled the large bag from the table, and trooped off around the table.</div><div>“It's fine,” Kimberly's eyes were narrow, but her tone was level. “I'd be bitter, too. You don't have to run away.”</div><div>Marilka stiffened as if to take insult, but she eventually nodded. “I'm not running away,” her fingers ran over the back of a chair, then another, and a third. “This is my seat. Opposite Willow. Unless you'd like he and I to sit together, and push you away?”</div><div>“I'll pass, thanks. It's not like—“</div><div>“Ladies,” and Willow's voice was dark, dark. “That is enough. You are making this room quite unlivable. You may either relax, or leave,” he indicated a door behind him, set deeply into the stone wall.</div><div>They shut up.</div><div>Robin and Leo exchanged looks. “Are you sure you can't go into this until everyone's here? Because honestly this is getting under my skin,” Leo said.</div><div>“Don't worry. Everyone will be arriving shortly, I believe.”</div><div>The door rattled in the casement, and squealed, and opened. Sarah stepped in, her short black leather coat flapping in the spring breeze. Waving one be-ringed hand, she took two large steps into the room to clear the door. And stopped. One hand pointed at Marilka.</div><div>“When did you call her, Birdman?”</div><div>“Earlier this evening, Spooky Girl. It's nothing that you have to worry about. I hope that with her help, we will be able to do something more than battle to a standstill.”</div><div>“Can we win?”</div><div>Willow shrugged. “Define winning.”</div><div>Favoring him with a hard look, Sarah turned and gestured someone in. It was Rose, who clutched her long red rain coat close under the assault of the wind.</div><div>“H...hello, everyone. Um. I don't know you, do I,” she asked of Robin, who shook his head. Raising one hand in salutation, he said, “Robin Redsson. Yes, really 'Red's son'. I'm pretty sure that some of my Nordic ancestors had no imagination whatsoever.”</div><div>Rose laughed, and stepped to one side of the doorway to make room for Isabel. Leo's lover carried her daughter on her hip. Leo hurried forward and took the child to the table, leaving Isabel free to shed her dark coat. She did this as Annie entered behind her. Annie wore no coat, but she did have several sweaters on, and she was carrying a big black guitar case, which she laid on the table carefully before turning to Rose for a hug.</div><div>“Hey, Rosie! I haven't seen you in forever! How have you been keeping?”</div><div>But Marilka narrowed her eyes, and then glared at Willow, her childish-looking petulance clear.</div><div>“Seven? Seven people, and a child?” She asked incredulously. “That's all you brought against this creature that you made possible?”</div><div>“The child will not be part of this. And besides, the ravens have ever been a selective and temperamental lot. I agree with them. There are few here, yes. But these few I would take with me against the greatest odds and the mightiest armies. They are strong and true, and they are loyal to each other.”</div><div>“None of which really helps. Nine people against the beast. Nine people against the great Pack of the Night? Their five lieutenants and one dark captain and countless shadowy pack mates, and we are going to route them out with nine people?”</div><div>“You forgot their construct,” Willow said, looking contemplatively at the ceiling. “Five lieutenants, one captain, and one demon. Plus assorted underlings.”</div><div>“That's what I mean! You're going to get massacred! They're only humans!”</div><div>“Marilka, I suggest you take a second look at these humans before you judge.” Willow's voice was chilly. “I have told you for some time that there is no such thing as 'only human', and if you insist on holding such prejudices, then you can leave. We will find a way to make do with eight.”</div><div>“Eight?” Rose put in. “That's the wrong number. Seven would work, but nine is better for magic.”</div><div>“I know, Rose. But if Marilka doesn't believe in what we can do, then she might as well not be here, and I don't want to have to deal with her whining.” He shook his head. “Anyway, Em. Look at these people. Gaze into their auras, and tell me that these are common humans. You can't and you know it.”</div><div>Marilka raised one eyebrow and rested her elbows on the table, apparently staring at nothing. Her eyes narrowed slightly, and she tilted her head. She looked at Sarah and squinted. Blinking, she shook her head and started again. When she would have started for the third time, she turned to Willow.</div><div>“Why the hell can't I see anything for her aura?” She pointed at Sarah. “She's not soul-dead, so that's not it. Explain.”</div><div>“Ahh.” And Willow turned to Sarah. “Spooky Girl, why don't you let it out a little. Marilka needs to understand, and she's not going to do that if you hold your aura under your skin.”</div><div>Sarah raised one eyebrow, and shrugged. Then she yawned, and gestured widely to Marilka. “Be my guest, short stuff. Gaze me, if you really want to.”</div><div>The girl rolled her eyes, and repeated her earlier performance, until she narrowed her eyes and tilted her head. Then she cried out and threw up her hands. Her chair tipped back, and she fell to the ground.</div><div>“Oww, fuck! Fucking fuck!” She stumbled to her feel, one hand still over her eyes. “What the hell was that?”</div><div>“That was Sarah's aura. From your response, I suspect that she was passing energy through it actively to brighten it up. That wasn't very nice, Sarah.”</div><div>Sarah shrugged. “She hasn't been very nice, either.”</div><div>“Oww, I guess,” Marilka said. “Ow. Are the rest of these people half that strong?”</div><div>“Oh, certainly. As I said,” Willow smiled a private little smile, “People are stronger than you give them credit for, Em. And after a little time on the wilder side of things, they adapt well.”</div><div>“Okay. Okay,” Marilka looked at the ceiling for a few seconds, her eyes flicking rapidly, focused on something inside her own head. “Okay, I can work with that.”</div><div>“What we're going to do,” she said, loudly enough to call the assembled group to silence. “What we're going to do, is dream this demon to death.”</div><div>And then she launched into her plan.</div><div></div><div>Some hours later, with the windows open to bring in some of the spring's wind, the adjourned with a plan. Outside, it was raining lightly, and the stonework was dark where water coated it, a second skin. They would have left in silence, if Willow had let them. But he smiled and hugged them, encouraged them and smiled. He gave them the confidence he had, and watched them walk out into the bright rain with hope in them. When they were gone, and even Marilka had left the room, there remained Kimberly and Sarah.</div><div>Sarah pulled the door open and stared out into the open meadow that masqueraded as Willow's back yard. She lit a cigarette. The click-skritch-chink of the lighter in her hands brought Kimberly's attention to it. Crossing the flagstone floor, she reached out and laid a hand on Sarah's wrist.</div><div>“You don't smoke. What's wrong? I mean,” she added after Sarah raised a disbelieving eyebrow. “Other than the whole situation? It's a pretty good shot, and it worked last time, didn't it?”</div><div>Sarah exhaled through her nose, streams of smoke blowing out like she was a dragon getting ready to torch someone. She shook her head. “It's not that. It just seems like this is going to get ugly. Yeah, it's going to regardless. But,” she took another puff of the cigarette. “I don't think that this is going to end well. Just a feeling.” Shrugging, Sarah breathed out again and sighed as the smoke rose in streamers from her mouth. It whipped away into the spring rains and the uproarious wind.</div><div>She shook her head. “Just a feeling. There's not going to be such a thing as 'just a feeling' soon. Magic and laws of sympathy. Bah.”</div><div>Kimberly reached out and took the cigarette from between Sarah's fingers. “You don't smoke. When did you take it up?”</div><div>“I didn't. It's sweet grass. Take a drag,” Sarah said, nodding  to the handroll. Kimberly did, and coughed before making to toss it to the floor. Sarah bent and snatched the cigarette out of the air. Holding it casually between her silver rings she turned to Willow, who was leaning against the table, eyes slightly out of focus as he watched some internal landscape.</div><div>“Birdman, will you smoke with us?”</div><div>Willow looked up sharply, then the furrow between his brows eased as he came up to speed. “Certainly.” He took the thin paper tube and turned to the east, south, west, and north, offering some smoke to each direction. Then he took a deep breath, blowing a few smoke rings toward the ceiling, where they faded into a haze. Then he sighed and expelled the rest of the smoke from his lungs.</div><div>“Sorry Spooky Girl. I can't manage to make smoking look as romantic as you do. I must be too bored by it.”</div><div>“Bored by it?” Sarah asked.</div><div>Willow nodded. “I took it up back when it was popular in the twenties. Kept going through the mid-fifties, when public interest dropped off. Took it up for a few years while I was staying with a man named Mountain Claussen, in the late seventeenth century after that. But since then I've not really bad the interest to. It's not like it's self-destructive for me. Keeping my respiratory system clean is fairly easy, as such things go.”</div><div>Sarah laughed, shaking her head. “No self-destruction? You take all the fun out of things, Birdman.”</div><div>“Perhaps I do, at that.” He shrugged into his coat and laid a hand on the dark wood of the table. “Come, I'm sure I have something in the fridge. You two should eat.”</div><div>“What about you, Willow? Too high and mighty to stoop to eating with us mortals?” Sarah teased.</div><div>“I've told you, there's no such thing as a 'mere' mortal. And no, I'm not high and mighty,” Willow looked almost embarrassed. “I got hungry while we were talking, so I went and got a late lunch.”</div><div>“But you were here the whole—“ Kimberly broke off, staring at him suspiciously. Then Sarah made an inarticulate choking noise.</div><div>“That, you,” she sputtered. “Muninn flew out the door while everyone was talking! You did that thing that you did to Rose and I, where you can be in two places at once! For a sandwich!” She punched him in the shoulder, hard enough the sit him back down on the table.</div><div>“Actually, I made an entire meal,” he raised his hands to placate Sarah's furious expression. “But after I ate, I put it in the fridge. So you can have some if you want to. There's quite a lot left over.”</div><div>Kimberly stepped in and grabbed Willow's arm. “Come on. If you feed me, man, I will let you live.” And she pushed him toward the hallway, deeper into his house. Sarah made for the exit, pulling her collar up as she watched the lovers leave, over her shoulder. Then Kimberly pulled up short as they were about to pass from the room.</div><div>“Sarah? Come on, you can't let him get away without feeding you, after what he did,” she stuck out her tongue at Willow, who flicked her nose. Then he looked at Sarah, and saw, she was certain, too deep with those calm, dark eyes. He nodded, seeming to be agreeing with Kimberly.</div><div>“Come on, Spooky Girl. Come eat with us.”</div><div>So, trailing smoke and doubts, Sarah closed the door and followed Kimberly toward the kitchen.</div><div></div><div></div><div>End of the Innocence</div><div></div><div>Stolen hours in the back of her car,</div><div>Parked behind the swell of a graveyard hill.</div><div>I don’t think the old bones took offense to us</div><div>Practicing life above their home-sepulchers.</div><div>-Elizabeth Belenos, “Stolen Hours”</div><div></div><div>Dusk was falling slowly, and Willow watched it fall.</div><div>The edges of the city felt it last, so here near the center it came earliest of all. Tall buildings were artificial mountains cutting off the spring sun earlier than they should. In the city, darkness fell early and left late. On the eastern horizon, rain clouds and April downpours turned the landscape into abstract impressionism, and Willow could hear the wind blowing the storm toward the city. It would be a wet night, and a fierce storm. He closed his eyes. There would be a frost, he felt, and turned to face the west, soaking up the last of the sun's heat. Then he took in a deep breath and blew it out, all at once. Stepping to the carved wooden chair he had been sitting at, Willow transferred the ravens perched on it to his shoulder. First Huginn, then Muninn.</div><div>High above the houses in the area, Willow had some minutes more of sunlight. The room he stood in was reminiscent of a sea-side widow's walk. In this high, round room, though, there was no glass between him and the elements. Underfoot, a watertight trapdoor creaked as Willow shifted his weight.</div><div>The air was clear, and clean. Willow smiled sadly, knowing that the rest of the night would be filled with little enough that resembled this pure place. And then he opened the trap door, and went down through it, to await the arrival of the small band he had put together. He went down to wait for the Corvus Clan.</div><div>In the living room, he stared at the furniture before adjusting a chair to face the door. Tugging at his shirt, he smoothed the gray cotton material. His pants were loose, and green, and they had many pockets in them. Most of them were filled. Hanging his coat over the back of the chair, he ran his fingers along its worn fabric. The latent magic from the spells woven into the cloth tingled under his fingers, gentle warmth that seeped into his hands as he stroked.</div><div>They came in twos and threes. The sisters Smith were arm-in-arm with Annie the musician. Rose and Sarah were smiling in a way they rarely did when apart, and between them seemed to have pushed Annie into a good mood. Kimberly brought Robin in, the two of them talking quietly. She took the battered guitar case while he pulled open the door, relinquished it to him. Isabel walked in with Leo, each holding one of Naomi's little hands.</div><div>When everyone was assembled, the eight of them stood in a loose crescent focusing on the man with the birds. Willow laced his fingers together and let them hang past his belt buckle. His gray, unadorned sweatshirt seemed to shine quietly in the dim light. Behind him, on the north side of the room, there was already a fire burning on the hearth. In sconces on the walls tall, fat candles burned, flickering wildly. Between one flicker and the next, Marilka was there. She wasn't the little girl she had been. Nor was she the stunning young woman. She looked thirtyish, and her red dress was the same style, now reaching to the floor. She wore a coat over top of that, navy blue and unbuttoned.</div><div>Willow raised one hand in greeting, dropped it. Isabel leaned against Leo, whispered in his ear. He whispered back, and she nodded, smiled shyly at Marilka.</div><div>“I like your coat.”</div><div>Her hair, less bright now that she was older, bobbed as she nodded. “Thank you. Willow, were you going to start things?”</div><div>“Yes.” He raised his voice, slightly. “Everyone, we are going to be in my living room for this. Kimberly and Marilka will show you how the room needs to be arranged. Naomi and I will head up to the guest room for the night.” Willow extended one hand to the child. Hesitantly, looking at her mother often, Naomi took his hand. He lead her away up the stairs.</div><div>Kimberly and Isabel watched him go, and once out of sight, the younger woman turned and slapped her hands together. "Okay, first thing to do is get everything out of the center of the room. We want a circle about fifteen feet in diameter. Then bring all the plants into the clear space."</div><div>They went to work, pairing up to move the heavier tables and then transferring the plants to the floor in haphazard arrangement. Shortly, the space was clear save for the small jungle of herbaceous plants. Marilka and Kimberly met each others gaze, nodded, then squinted at the circle. Kimberly pointed at a point in the circle several feet away from her. "Would someone put the vervain right there?"</div><div>Robin looked at her blankly. "If you tell me what vervain looks like, sure."</div><div>"It, uh. I'm not sure," her eyes blanked for a moment, and then she pointed. "It's that one, all the way to the left. Looks tall and leggy, kinda spiky almost. Closer, closer. That's the one."</div><div>Marilka crossed to the indicated spot on the circle before Robin made it and spoke to Kimberly. "How about we put it here instead," she stepped slightly to the side. Of we do that, the yarrow and antimony can bracket it—"</div><div>"—and then we can mirror that at the other corners, I like it! Robin, put the plant where Marilka is standing. Sarah, Rose, can you get the yarrow and antimony?"</div><div>Rose looked lost until Sarah touched her elbow and directed her to the right pot. They grabbed the plants and set them carefully in place, according to Kimberly's instruction and Marilka's fine tuning. Parsley, rosemary, and sage were set at points within the circle. A carefully pruned rosebush, full with the first blush of spring, was located in the thicket as Isabel stuck her hand in looking for something else.  Juniper and lilac, lavender and violet, they all had a place in Kimberly's design, until eventually the shape of a great swirl was described on the floor.</div><div>The plants started around the perimeter of the circle, then marched slowly inward, until they had made it around the circle three times before coming to a finish in the very center. Something about the layout made the viewer dizzy as they tried to follow it. Robin tried to walk the spiral after he had lost track of exactly where the lines went three times. Marilka caught him and pulled him gently away to sit on a chair.</div><div>Willow returned, then, and smiled when he saw the work that had been done. He crossed to Isabel, stepping carefully around the perimeter of the circle.</div><div>“Naomi is sleeping. She'll sleep until someone comes for her, and if we don't come back,” Willow laid one hand on Isabel's shoulder as she swayed, very slowly. “If we don't come back, someone safe and good will come for her. I promise you.”</div><div>“Who,” Isabel whispered.</div><div>“I don't know. I didn't specify. Just that it would be someone who would be good for her. What she needed. It's better than choosing someone. This way we know that it will be a good person.” Willow squeezed her arms. “But don't worry. I will do my absolute best to make sure that everyone come back. Even the Pack.”</div><div>Then he turned to Kimberly and Marilka, who stood shoulder to shoulder watching the spiral they had built. Their heads were together in consultation, and after a  moment, Marilka nodded and gestured at one of the pots. It slid a few inches to the left, followed by the rest of the pots in the circle, keeping everything in the same place, relative to the others.</div><div> “Ladies, I see that everything is in readiness. If you could guide everyone else to their places, and then take yours. Sarah, a moment?”</div><div>He drew her aside and murmured in her ear, then they joined hands and knelt next to the circle. He placed his right hand on the edge of the circle, his left held by Sarah, who set her left hand further along the circle. Their eyes closed, and after a few moments the air inside the circle began to shimmer, like a heat mirage. The effect grew until it encompassed the spiral entire, and began to climb into the air. All around the edge, the Corvus Clan watched with varying amounts of anxiety. It was Robin who spoke up, though, seeming unconcerned.</div><div>“I thought that producing a physical effect with magic was showy and wasteful, Willow?” He smiled as he said it.</div><div>Without opening his eyes, Willow smiled. “What Bel did was wasteful. This is a side-effect. You can't light a blowtorch without striking some sparks. Now shut up and fall asleep.”</div><div>Robin laughed, and then he stopped, head lolling with the rest of the circle. Sarah stood and made her way to her seat before slumping to one side. Willow donned his coat and shifted the ravens to a perch on the back of his chosen chair. And then he, too, dreamed.</div><div></div><div>Leo dreamed...</div><div>They came to him in a dream, telling him of the power he could have, of the great things he could do. A man with skin like the bark of a deep-rooted oak, and a woman as green as Ireland's moss spoke to him inside a great darkness, and said to him that life was a dream, and that, if he did not fight for them, then the dream of his life would end. And though these figures were powerful, they claimed no power over him, saying rather that they would not compel him, but the battle coming was one of metaphors and magic and life. And if it was not fought to the fullest, then there would be death and dreck and no salvation. Not even for these godlike figures who stood before him, humbling themselves for his aid.</div><div>And he said,</div><div>“What?”</div><div>They told him of how the dreamers were few, but he would lead them. Though he would fight alongside those whose power outstripped his own, his spirit was staunch, and would serve better than a hundred warriors who fought for coin.</div><div>“I don't know about that,” he said. “I'm pretty sure you'd do better with numerical superiority.”</div><div>In his namesake the lion they put their trust, and he was the true child of the lion. Any battle he joined he would fight until he stood victorious or bled out his life on the field.</div><div>“That's called stubbornness,” he said. “I get it from my father.”</div><div>And they said to him that his father must have been a great man.</div><div>"He was bull-headed too,” replied Leo.</div><div>They told him then that he must lead the dreamers and they must fight, for should the demon escape all would be ruin, and the death of an age would come upon them, and all the people of the world might know despair.</div><div>“Are you sure there isn't someone else who could do this?” said Leo, who knew nothing of fighting other than what he had learned in grade school, which largely consisted of how to curl up to keep the pain to a minimum.</div><div>There is not, he was informed in no uncertain terms, and he must listen now. For they had needed to find human dreamers to fight this thing, for these gods of the dream were powerful things, but different, and they could not affect the night-time world as could Leo.</div><div>“I'm special?” Said Leo. “That doesn't make sense,”</div><div> “It is the only sense we have,” replied the gods of the dream. “And you must fight the demon in your way, before we can fight in ours.”</div><div>And Leo was skeptical.</div><div>“A demon,” he said to them, “really?”</div><div>And they said yes, really. For even if there are no such things created in the course of time, living by their own demiurge, then there surely are those created by man. And this one was empowered by humanity, they said. A demon of despair and hate and anger-turned-inward. A great oozing pustule of a creature, chained and made to play guard dog by those who knew no better.</div><div>And Leo asked what he could do.</div><div>The painter –for painter he was, one who created reality from illusion—was nothing special, they assured him.</div><div>And this did little to comfort him.</div><div>But they reached inside him together and they drew out from him that which glowed and shone with the brightness of the stars and said</div><div>look, here in our hands is that which is good and right within you, and there is much of it, and they armored him with it until he was arrayed all about with mail of brightest night and plate of starry luminosity.</div><div>Won't you help me? Said Leo, who was sorely afraid to fight the beast which the words of this god and goddess had called up in him.</div><div>And they read the thought from him and laughed, not unkindly, at him. And they told him We are not gods, but neither are we men such as you are a man. And for all its fierceness, this creature can still be brought to bay by one who will stand before it unflinching.</div><div>I am not such a one, said Leo, quailing.</div><div>You had better be, they replied, and the place where they were was no longer the place where they had been for his armament and before him, on a plain of bones, the great demon of dark fire and twisting iron was chained like a dog to a post, and all around this creature the bones were cracked and licked clean of marrow, and all the juices had been gotten out of them save for a few. These few had names, and they were Bel, and Jessica, and Tuomas, and Mary, and Wesley. But what they were he could not say for he was a mortal man, and it is not for mortals to know the subtle truths without dear payment and dire need.</div><div>About him were arrayed his warriors of the dream and they too had names. And the names were Annie, and Robin, and Sarah, and Eddie, and Leslie, and Jane. Their names were Rose, and Tony, and Zoe. They too bore weapons and shew on their bodies the marks of armor gleaned from their very being. And they were of one mind and Leo knew that they had made themselves ready for the veriest of battles, though the air upon the plain was choking and tasted of the soul-death that was the sole province of this place.</div><div>So drawing for himself a sword which shone out a light calling for blood and fury with the dying gasps of a sun, Leo went like his namesake the lion to do battle with the dark fire, and iron, and the doom which waited for him. It gnashed its teeth and made a great and terrible roar like the wailing of a people lost, and it roused itself to feast upon his flesh, and to crack his bones and gorge itself on the sweetness that dwelt there.</div><div>The beast struck with the swiftness of a locomotive, and with the strength of one also, and Leo flew through the air to tumble, doll-like, to a stop. It struck again, at Annie, and she too was thrown, as was Isabel.</div><div>But Sarah stood firm against the onslaught, though the fire of the demon burned at her she laughed and laughed. Attacking with only her fists, she fought as a woman possessed making blow after blow, and when the iron hide of the beast began to buckle under she laughed all the harder. And Robin stood firm, though the bone-strewn ground around him shattered and drove him to his knees. He fought with nothing but his music to shield him, though blood flowed from his finger and the claws of the beast raked blazing furrows through his flesh. As the fighting of his allies was like the fighting of the gods, so to was his music the music of ages, and it kept him whole when he should have been destroyed.</div><div>But it was a demon, and demons are not weak. Though pained by Sarah's fists and the shining tones Robin called from his instrument, it redoubled its efforts and bore Sarah to the ground, savaging about her with its claws and it's teeth. It sank its fangs deep into her shoulder and feasted on the blood it found there, and Sarah screamed. Pain and rage and utter terror shook through her voice, and Leo raised himself up and swung his sword in her defense. And he cleaved the monster, but it was not a mortal blow. Though it retreated from Sarah's form, which wavered like a heat-haze and vanished, the demon struck at Leo's blade and it was shattered as no mortal blade could be. And Leo dropped to his knees as something in him broke also.</div><div>It clawed at his chest, which was armored, and at his gorget and helm which kept him from harm. In its frenzy the beast drew the helm from his head and laid about his face with fangs and claws, but was not wary of the blades of the other warriors, which struck it about the body and hacked from it with a great shower of gore one of its claws. And Leo looked up into the tooth-filled mouth of the demon, and knew that he was going to die now, tonight.</div><div></div><div>Annie dreamed...</div><div>And in her dream, she was of a legion. Her friends were her comrades in arms, and this was a battle to the death. Hers or some other's. She bore two weapons: a barbed whip of many cruel points hung from her left hand, darker than the night that was without stars. And in her right hand she carried the wrath of the just, and also a lightning bolt forged from the brilliance of moonbeams on the anvil of the sea.</div><div>The gods of the dream-scape, of the plain of bones and death, the lord and lady of the glen, whose presence was like a stone in deep water –cool and peaceful—were the same gods who had armed her with herself and told her to do battle. So she stood alongside heroes. She did not flinch when the dark terror stirred, nor did she squint in the glare of the weapons and armor formed from the others' soul stuff. Her own armor was stylized in the Gallic manner, picking out her every muscle in the materiel she wore –celestial steel highlighted with the red of rage, of blood, of the bright vengeance of the dawn.</div><div>The creature against which they strove was mighty and it drove her back with its first barrage of blows, but she stood against and saw that it how preparing to take one of the heroes with whom she fought. It crouched over his chest, tearing at the edges of his armor. The steel began to smoke and flex against the beast's ravenous attack, and Annie rose up and let the true fury of battle fall over her as she cast her lightning bolt at its back. The beast roared and spun to face its attacker.</div><div>The lash struck about the creature's face and slashed through fire and blood, to tangle on the bones of iron that supported the beast's hulking frame. Jerking her arm back, Annie threw the demon from the form of her companion and again she hurled her lightning bolt. And a third time, as the beast rose to its full height and bellowed rage that shook that plain and rattled alike the bones of the heroes and those laying on the ground.</div><div>And as she drew back her lightning bold for another blow to the demon, the very beast smote at her with both of its claws, and marked her. Her armor which held up so well against dark fire and scorching blood was, against the chill iron claws, utterly useless, and she was wounded. Two long furrows, hot-then-cold reminders of demon-fire etched along her sides.</div><div>Annie cried out and fell, for her wounds were grave.</div><div>And as she held them, the beast rose above her.</div><div></div><div>Sarah dreamed...</div><div>And when she turned in her sleep and made as if to rise, Willow's voice filled her half-sleeping mind. It sounded lighthearted even now. But then, he always was, for her.</div><div>“You're leaving me now, when I need you more than ever? Oh, the shame.”</div><div>And she rolled over and fell into a deeper sleep, if just to show him who was whom. As she felt herself drifting off, a thought floated through her head. I am the story that is telling itself. And she couldn't have said whether the thought was hers, or Willow's.</div><div>So she told herself a story.</div><div>She was a knight in the land of Vhantinsa, beyond the deserts of Vemate and the Great Ravine, which was the province of the Antuliki. In the court of King Emloka Calo she served, and she dreamed that her true love had been list to her.</div><div>There is a place in the land of Lhosa, far away across the deserts of Vemate and the great mountains that are to the distant west, called the Forests of the Night, where the spirits dance.</div><div>She was not a woman of books, but noble quests and endeavors, in her dream. Thus it was that when she heard of the Forests of the Night where the spirits dance, she set off at once thither.</div><div>With her she took her royal Charger, and her armor, which shone with the light of a thousand mirrors. Also with her she took her squire, whose loyalty was as unwavering as the sun.</div><div>The knight rode south, from the moors of her kingdom into the hilly regions where lived the Clan-lords of the Dymari who, when their arrows fell, were like the sheeting rain of tempests.</div><div>She met with the Clan-lords in conclave, and they told her many things. They spoke of their ancient tale-weavers, and of the stories of legend, and the Forests of the Night, where spirits dance.</div><div>They give her a horse bow.</div><div>And at their counsel, the bright knight of the shining armor took off the armor from her legs, that she be freer to guide her horse on the journey.</div><div>She, with her horse and squire loyal, rode to the east, and came upon the mountains of Set-Semayai, the dwarf people who are wise in the ways of the earth. She met with them in deep mineshafts, where they heard the whispers of the earth. Her quest was told, and debated, and quarreled –for the dwarves of Set-Semayai are ever quarrelsome- and the dwarves promised her aid.</div><div>Like the rippling of a forest pool, word of her quest and query went out among the dwarves, and their lore-keepers came from the spine and crown of the earth. They came up from the deep mines where even their brethren fear to tread, and they told of what they knew.</div><div>“The Forests of the Night are to the north,” they told her,</div><div>“Where the spirits dance, the night is ever-present.” So said the rumors of stone and ore.</div><div>The dark the wild Shaman of the of the deep shafts spoke as with one voice, which to his foundations shook the clever squire. “Thy blade, noble knight, is inadequate.”</div><div>And they reforged her sword, ‘til the strength of the mountain’s bones was in it, and the magic of the shaman’s runes was bound to it, and the very earth responded to its striking.</div><div>And the knight rode north, away from the caverns of the shaman, and took off the armor from her arms, that she could better wield the sword of the mountains</div><div>It was many months, and she passed though other lands, the places of the Galoki and the Fennar and the Moltu and places which did not have names. She met with people who thought that they were the only in the world, and who thought that there were no other humans in all the land. But she was not afraid, and her loyal squire and Royal Charger accompanied her.</div><div>Northward she passed, through the lands of her Kingdom, through the lands of the In-Shar Vara, where once lived the elder people, who ruled when the world was younger. There she stopped, and dismounted, and took from her body the armor that covered it, standing with her clever squire in naught but leathern garments. Her clever squire spoke to her then, saying</div><div>“This city is a graveyard. Does our quest take us into the vast Necropolis?</div><div>The knight nodded, and found her way to the edge of the charnel city of the dead, whose still-standing buildings like dead fingers rose from broken grave-dirt.</div><div>When night well and truly fell on the knight wandering the city, the clouds hung low and the rain fell from them like unto a flood. And when the rain began to clear, there were the ghosts of the Old Ones, who had ruled the earth from the Long-Ago.</div><div>“You are the knight who comes, seeking her beloved poet in the Forests of the Night,” they said. “You come with a bow from the Horse-People, and a sword made from the bones of the mountain. You come here, with no armor, before the Dead.”</div><div>The knight nodded, and drew her sword.</div><div>“We, who are Dead, know the way to the Forests of the Night, and to the souls who dance there. You will not return.”</div><div>The knight nodded again, and hung the horse-bow from her back.</div><div>The ghosts of the Old Ones opened the path for her.</div><div>And then she left for the Forests of the Night, where the spirits dance. She dismounted from her charger, and passed the reins to her loyal squire, and she entered, and was seen no more.</div><div>And that was how the story ended. And Sarah stirred and sank deeper into sleep, leaning against the chair, feeling the power Willow had been able to pull from that kind of dream. And she returned to the field of bones, and to the beast that waited there.</div><div></div><div>Mary dreamed...</div><div>In her dream the bandages on her arms, the electrical-taped scars and scars-to-be, and the keloids that wrapped around her biceps were gone, and the bandages themselves were coiled on the ground at her feet. She felt her arms with something akin to astonishment. And she smiled. An honest smile graced her features, and she patted all over herself for the scars that dotted her body, for the open wounds that should have been there. The little cuts and the big ones.</div><div>There were none. Mary laughed aloud and spun in place in her joy. She felt free, and lighter than the air about her. The chains she had worn in the form of her flesh was dissolved, and she knew who she had to thank for it. She had labored for Bel, she had followed her instincts and taken the gifts her disfigurement gave her. Without her scars she would not be able to read the paths of what was to come, but without her scars she would have no need for the multi-part lineaments of the future.</div><div>But the creature, the demon they had summoned and bound. She had tied it to them with her scars, and bound it to take them from her body as it grew. When Bel declared it time, it was to have eaten her scars and grown in the doing. It was to have left her with unmarred skin and taken into it the knowledge of what was and what would be. And how she had no scars. Mary sighed happily. Bel must have decided it was time.</div><div>And then Mary had a second thought. The way Jess had mutinied. The way they had all stood there. The way Bel had looked at them, and ordered them home. It would have sounded the same if she had been ordering them to siege the ramparts of Hell. What if Bel hadn't released it the way she said she was going to? What if she had decided that she, Bel, was the only person who really needed a guardian?</div><div>What if taking her scars and her power had made her more vulnerable, not less?</div><div>It was then that Mary realized that she was being overshadowed by something. She turned slowly, holding trepidation in her heart, and was confronted by the beast they had summoned. She knew it in an instant, and she saw its secret name. It was the name she had inscribed on it. The names they had all inscribed on it. The demon was them, they were the demon. Their darkness made manifest, and feeding on itself. Like the Hindu Face of Glory, the beast devoured itself. But in this creature's feasting, it grew bigger, and darker, and became more than it was.</div><div>Dark flames and hot iron and the caked smell of blood enfolded her, like the arms of the beast enfolded her. And while terror clenched her tight, it lifted her to its mouth. Mary found the breath to scream as it tipped back its head and drank her in, devouring her and growing larger thereby.</div><div>In her bed, Mary screamed. Her back arched and muscles stood out on her neck. Her eyes were resolutely shut, and as she flailed she could feel her scars pushing into her flesh. In her dream, and in her bed, Mary screamed on. The darkness grew.</div><div></div><div>Tuo dreamed...</div><div>And in his dreams he ran with the Pack, and they fought like beasts and they were great, and triumphant, and there was none who would not fall in submission rather than risk the rage of the Pack. The knowledge was sweet on his tongue, a panacea for his rage, for his fear. And he need fear no longer. Before him, in the long dark of the alley that the Pack claimed as their own, the shadows stretched long, longer than he had ever seen them.</div><div>Something was living in the shadows, and it took him long moments to know what it was. When the knowledge came to him he felt no relief, but he was curiously devoid of apprehension. The darkness had taken his fear, and it was their guard dog now. The Hound of the hounds, he thought in the quiet spaces of his own mind. The fear he had felt would be the fear of the enemy, now, and they would be savaged by nameless dread, as had assailed him.</div><div>He saw the darkness rise around him, and he ran with it. The night enfolded him and though the day drove no spikes of terror into his heart, he felt the protection of the dark preferable. The was a rattle and his hand was held fast by a manacle. Odd. Tuomas shook his head. Odd. All around him he could feel the unmistakeable odor of the demon, his own name cut into its flesh and his own spirit its motive force. And yet the Hound of darkness was doing nothing to remedy his incarceration. He tugged at his one arm with the other, but soon found that other bound as well. This time, rather than a manacle and chain, it was clearly the cut of wire against his flesh that he felt. Feeling a deep reservation that he refused to call fear, Tuo pulled against it. He felt barbs dig into his flesh, and in an instant he was wrapped from wrist to shoulder in the tough, galvanized wire. It pulled him to the ground, and he felt the pavements of Swett street below his body. Just as Bel must have felt, he thought suddenly. Just as Bel must have felt when we stood and waited for her to die.</div><div>He felt another turn of the barbed wire wrapped around his arms, and he was spreadeagled on the pavement at the mouth of Swett street. He struggled and though there was no give in the wire, he managed to move his arms at the cost of driving the barbs into his flesh. Still he did not cry out.</div><div>That was when he saw the spikes, and the great muscular hands which held them, and set them against his wrists. Then he began to gibber and flail. He upset the positioning of the spike twice, and the wire was drawn tight. He could no longer move. The spike was set, and he could feel the dull point of it, a caricature of a nail placed against his wrist. Then the hammer came down.</div><div>In his warm corner, in his sleep, Tuomas convulsed as he screamed, save for one arm which remained curiously still.</div><div></div><div>Wes dreamed...</div><div>It was like a great high, he found. Everything was clear and sharp-edged when he looked at it, and then faded off into an impressionist's brush strokes when he wasn't. Somehow it seemed like the enlightenment he'd been looking for since just about forever was within his grasp. Show me the light, let me inside and show what it's all about, he found himself repeating, over and over.</div><div>All about him, there were visions of sandy beaches and a great, visibly orb-like sun. Normally, all he—or anyone, Wesley supposed—could see was the great white-yellow solar disc. But this one, hanging above white sand and aquamarine waters, was a great orb of molten gold. It hung pendulous in the sky</div><div>Aware that he was quailing beneath that great sphere, Wes forced himself to stand upright, and thrust out his chest. The wheat-gold hair that he wore, brassy, down to his collarbones slid back to reveal the large necklace he wore, based on some of the grave goods found on Norse kings. On top of his white shirt. And he looked up again, at the flat, cloudy-white sky. The same white as the smoke from metal in a microwave. The same white as a plain linen shirt. And he looked up, and beheld himself. Wes flinched back and, flailing his arms, slipped to his knees, and sank into the sand, which was suddenly quicksand.</div><div> He'd had trips turn bad before, and the suddenly sludgy, suddenly not-white sand, were things he'd lived through before. Those sinkholes in SoCal would eat a man in a second if he wasn't careful. But Wes had always been careful, and he kept being careful now. He couldn't die in his dream, he told himself. And even so, the movement to float on his back was immediate and complete. Just as he had been taught, he stroked gently for the edge of the pit. It had to be there.</div><div>He found it, drew himself out, and found that what he had pulled his was onto was a coral reef. The tiny reef-building creatures, rather than dying underfoot like they should have been doing, started biting at him. Little, tiny bites from almost microscopic teeth that they shouldn't have had. And all around him, Wes saw only quicksand. Trying to swim in quicksand was like trying to swim in a pool full of jello, and would make you dead with equal alacrity.</div><div>Now he felt like two tabs of acid were making their way through his system. He knew he was standing, in that schoolboy-knows-his-letters way, but to look at it, to feel it with his rapidly warping hands, his body was falling to pieces, filtering down into the choral reef. Now the fear began to rise in him. He was not going to lose himself in that. Wes slid his hands over where his face should have been, but he wasn't greeted by the comforting sight of his own palms sliding across his eyes. Rather, it was a pair of great writhing tentacles, until he pulled them away with a small shriek.</div><div>They were just hands. He stopped. No, they weren't. As he looked closely at his arms, which seemed to have stopped wavering, stopped shifting form, he saw that they were, in fact moving. His skin was crawling all over him. All around his hands, and up his arms, into the cuffs of his shirt. And he could feel it on his face now, as he paid attention to it. And when he looked closer he saw how his skin was crawling. Worms the color of flesh danced across his skeleton, giving him the appearance of life, while they sucked the last bit of corporeality out of him. He could feel his bones sagging away as the worms found the nourishment to be had there, and drank of it. The marrow, and the calcium of the bones, and the chewy cartilage.</div><div>He called on the beast. It had to answer him. He had poured his self into it. Through all the trips, all the searches for enlightenment, he had always known who he was. Under the makeup and the dyes and the women and the men, it had always been Wesley Brandon Westley...No, wait. Westley had been the name of a boy in his math class in second grade. And Brandon was his brother's name.</div><div>Wes shook his head, and tried to bring his name to mind again. Wes. That was all he came up with. Short for Westerly, perhaps? He twitched, and couldn't remember what he was trying to do. Thinking hard, he pressed a hand to his forehead, and found nothing there. No hand, no forehead. No body, as far as he could tell. He couldn't feel anything at all. But before him, something was answering. He knew without thinking—what had he been thinking about, before?--that it was a demon. It was a demon built of bodies, and it had all the confidence of a man named Wesley Anders Datone, who had always known who he was.</div><div>And he looked into the face of the beast, and the face was his. Smiling, sure, and utterly devoid of humanity. He stared into the eyes of the abomination and felt chill claws raking through his soul.</div><div>And he screamed.</div><div></div><div>Jessica dreamed...</div><div>and in her dream she was a skeleton with skin, and she knew that her eyes stared out from sunken sockets. Her teeth were still broken, but she felt power in her veins, and she made herself whole. She licked a red tongue over teeth of steel shining bright in the midnight, and she flexed her claws with their dexterous, sharp digits. And she looked around the darkness that shrouded her, and she knew that all down and about her was the very stuff of dream.</div><div>And she reached about her, and she knew that this was not her dream. But the darkness about her was powerful, and she fed it with her body, and was fed by it. She felt thinner, weak and enervated, but the stillness around her became the stillness of a waiting beast. Of a great predator preparing to pounce. The stillness that comes before sending someone to their grave.</div><div>She knew it was a demon before it made itself a physical body. She knew what it looked like before there was light. Or before she had eyes to see. It stood in a circle in the dust, and it wore seven bodies. One of them was hers, and then the light came up. It was not light-in-the-darkness, where truths were revealed. It was not moonlight, telling subtle lies about what it saw and making poetry of prosaic truth.</div><div>Instead, it was the dirty gray of used washing water, similar to a dove-gray dawn only in the name of the color. Indeed, the character was different. The dawn's gray was hopeful, full, ready to burst into color and light. This was flat and uninspired, the light of streetlights and foxfire. Everything under its light was simply...itself. Under that light, everything looked dead, from people to clothing. When it moved, that was all it did. There was no hidden motive force, no metaphor or simile. Things were, or they were not, and there was no mystery at all, hidden in those grim visions.</div><div>And Jess looked around the circle, and saw around her the unsmiling bodies of the demon, the creature that they had summoned and fed the worst of themselves to. It had grown large to fit them all in, and it had grown strong in the fertile soil of their minds. She watched the demon, and the bodies it wore in her dream. Those bodies moved, they twitched, they had the mannerisms belonging to them, just as if they were real people. They wore ritual robes over normal clothing, which was shredded away to rags beneath, as if confronted by some pressure-washer, or a great sandstorm had stripped them.</div><div>There was a difference, though. It lay in the face, and the eyes. Said to be the portal to the soul, the eyes were where Jess would have expected the nature of the demon to show. Fiery sockets or blank darkness or tears of blood. Something to reveal the nature of the obscenity that they had called. It had come into being from the aether, from magic, and from their own boiling darknesses. The little shadows that had grown and spread until they were ruling passions. The faces were universally expressionless. There was no grimace of hate in the mien of Annalise, no calculating squint marred Bel's visage. The hidden melancholy in Tuo's face was gone along with Wesley's easy brutality and quick anger, replaced with the same vacant expression that they all wore. It wasn't that they seemed stupid or unknowing: they were merely apathetic.</div><div>The eyes were peaceful. No strife or hatred showed there, either. Nor was there any of the emotion that they had poured into the beast. Where was all the blood they had spilled? Where the iron they had forged into its spirit? Whence came this blank obscurity of purpose? It should have been slavering with fury and fear and pain, as they had made it. A mad guard dog loyal to no one and nothing but its creators. Unassailable because it was them. Wildly powerful, made of the purity that they had put into it. Like a blade was sharp and true, having only one purpose, so too this creature should have been utterly without remorse or knowledge of anything but its purpose. It should have been a weapon in their hand, savaging their enemies.</div><div>But it just stared at her, this circle of dull cupidity, and did nothing at all.</div><div>There had to be more here, and Jess was determined to find it. She knelt and there was a susurrus as the other figures in the circle knelt. Jess lowered her head, and from the sounds of rustling cloth the other members of her circle, the demon, had followed suit. There was more to this demon than was living in her dream, just as there was more to the beast than just her hate and dully smoldering resentment.</div><div>The change from lucid dream to trance came easily, and she slipped into the prepared state of mind that let her work with magic. A personality that contained nothing but imperatives, and saw the world as it was on the surface and beneath that, at the same time. And then she opened her eyes. The beast was still there, and he did not look complaisant.</div><div>It crouched, rather than kneeling, and its form should have been shrouded with fire. Indeed it probably was so engulfed, but it was the fire of the Pack, and Jess knew that from the inside, and it did not hinder her vision. It managed to hulk whilst being so close to the ground as to resemble a rodent. At its feet there lay a row of corpses, which were of course, those of the pack. Tidied up like washing left too long undone, they were still at peace, as she had seen. But while she watched, Jess saw the demon lifting a corpse to its hidden face as if to administer a kiss. But rather than that, the creature leaned closer still and, contorting its skull horribly, ripped off the lower jaw from the corpse it was holding.</div><div>A long, decidedly prehensile and preternaturally strong tongue wormed out of its mouth, and licked its way down to the open hole in the face where the mouth had been. The tongue was gone, as was most of the throat. The rest of the face was still present, the lip pushed back from the upper mandible by the chomp taken by the demon. One by one, the tongue began pulling parts of the face out or off. Much of the skin, hanging loose, was ripped off. Using already bloody fingers the demon worked out the teeth of the corpse. Then it moved down from the unrecognizable head to the hands, which it methodically bit off, one finger at a time. Then it opened its mouth extra wide and ate the hands in one bite each. The feet received the same treatment. She shuddered. Death and obscurity, just an unmarked grave for the cowards of the world. It wasn't going to be her death, not if she had to kill everyone she knew to get her way. She would die well known. Famous or infamous, it made no difference to her. Her name would be on the lips of thousands, long after her death. She knew it with the certainty of a stone.</div><div>But the beast shuffled on to the next corpse, and began again. Jess regarded the  creature levelly, and watched its muscles moving under skin made slippery with grime, blood, and sweat. And this creature was a metaphor for the parts the pack had cut out of themselves? While its movements superficially resembled a rodent, the actual physicality of this metaphorical demon bore the most resemblance to a brutish man. It seemed almost that Jess should recognize him from somewhere down the list of men in her life. But if the shape had been drawn from the great number of men who had hurt her, then it hadn't been one of those who was bad enough—or good enough—to deserve a name. Just a massive reminder of the dull and furious past. It was only in the particulars that the demons body differed from that of a real person's.</div><div>Firstly, as Jess understood it, there was no way for the demon to actually manifest in reality. It was purely a construct of mind and will, and thus would never be a physical threat. Then again, as Bel had drilled the Pack again and again, a being of pure will, existing in the plane of the mind alone, could do significant damage. Significant enough that Jess thought the woman might well be a ticket out of obscurity and into the relative safety of having the biggest weapon of anyone around.</div><div>Firstly, as Jess understood it, there was no way for the demon to actually manifest in reality.

Significant enough that Jess thought the woman might well be a ticket out of obscurity and into the relative safety of having the biggest weapon of anyone around.</div><div>Secondly, the beast differed from a human form in the body itself. It had the right general shape, but when any individual part was regarded in the abstract, it was a thing of monstrous appearance as well as nature. It was as if the demon looked simply more human than it looked anything else. Its hands were paw like, and the knuckles that adorned it looked more like blunted toes than anything else. Enormously strong they may have been, but it seemed like the creature had been built out of spare parts more than a proper person's components. But then, Bel had said that the demon was being drawn into being from the parts of each of them that they disliked. Was it possible that there was more to that than just the emotional, the metaphysical?</div><div>Jess focused her trance further. There had to be a deeper truth than what she was seeing. Something more elemental than this corpse-devouring ghoul. And as she settled deeper into the metaphor that was called by some reality and by some fantasy, she found the plain of bones. It was as she took in the sight of the dead, the nameless, faceless dead who had rotted and decayed by the hundreds-thousands-maybe millions—that she began to understand what it was they had called up. And in the very depths of her being, in the part of her that she no longer admitted to, she felt something flare bright and die. She saw the beast of flame and smoke and dark iron. She saw the demon of blood and hate, and she saw it feasting on the marrow of the bones nearest its place of conjuring. That part of her that died exercised one last power before it went, some final effort of will. Jess spoke.</div><div>“Noli evocare quod reprimere non potes.” Latin. Do not call up that which you cannot put down.</div><div>She saw the field of bones with dull eyes, and watched the very bones of her own skeleton cracked open and licked at for their marrow. And she felt the obscene tongue of the creature licking at her soul. Only then did she scream, but scream she did. Her throat became raw, and she bled, and under the weight of all her chains and charms in her bed, her body fought sluggishly. But her eyes were closed.</div><div></div><div>Robin dreamed</div><div>And what he dreamed was a great battlefield of long ago. It lay strewn thickly with the bones of the dead, and though they stood starkly in the air, there was nothing on the field to stir the bones of the dead. No scavengers, no dark ravens, no vermin of the field. Just mile upon mile of the dead, and the bones of ages past. And then there was a great beast, it seemed to Robin, chained to a post of iron by links forged of spirit. The gleamed bright, but were not in themselves enough to contain the great creature. It was a beast of flame, and blood, and hot pain. Robin could feel the conflagration from where he stood, at some remove to the creature.</div><div>He saw figures armed and armored, and knew within himself that they were the forms of his friends. He knew that they were battling the creature, for he could see that much with his eyes, and yet there seemed to be more to the battle. It was not, Robin could feel, just about subduing the beast. It was not just the binding of a demon.</div><div>When he felt something hanging from his back, Robin almost jumped, and when he realized what it was, he quickly unlimbered his guitar. Epic battle was nothing to him. He couldn't swing a sword, and he had a hunch that the gun he wore –he checked—yes, that he wore in this dream world was nothing that would truly damage to that great beast. There was a secret to it, and he would not find it by trying to beat its skull in with a blunt object. The only thing he could really bring against it was his music. Music that would speak to the soul. Music he had in him somewhere. He knew that is was there. It would come for him.</div><div>So he played. The tune meandered at first, trying to find something that felt right. He found his way through minor chords, and sevenths, and power chords, and something seemed to stick about the power chords. Wide open and unsubtle was just right for this great demon, this creature of blood and iron.</div><div>Robin couldn't just hear the music. As he closed his eyes, he could see they way it moved, like some great dragon stretching out from his guitar, wrapping around the field of battle. Like he was some kind of snake charmer, Robin started adding riffs, atonal notes and combination that fit into the shape he was playing, that resonated on his skin, in his soul. And a shrieking coming from the demon –that could only have come from the demon, its great vocal chords clotted with blood and its deep chest built out of a bellows of iron.</div><div>He watched the beast turn to him as he played, and he knew that it knew him. It felt, staring at it, as if he should know it.</div><div>And the music spoke to him, and it told him of another place, and it took him, and he went with it. And he was Robin no more.</div><div>And he was in the great plains of Hollia while he dreamed, and he had the knowledge of the ways of power, and he was a hidden mover behind the ways that were. And yet...</div><div>And yet, he knew that was not all he was, and that there was much of another in him, and it came to him that he was also in another place. In the dreams of his dreams he saw it, a great plain of bones and death. But that was distant, and while time moved but slowly in his dreams, he lived greatly in the time afforded him by the Lands that We Know.</div><div>He became Amalkreth, who was a wizard of note, and his powers were not insubstantial. It was in the knowing of things that he became one of power, and it was in that power that he began to suspect that the other him who lived in his dreams had need of the power he had accrued in his time in the Lands.</div><div>It was that which led the wizard of note on a quest. It took him far from Hollia, and out from the borders of Wellian Grand itself. He crossed the moors of Vhantinsa and the land of Lhosa, he called upon the spirits of the Swarming Dark, and remained undevoured. He met with dwarves, and the hidden elves of the wood, and the ancient truths hidden in the ruins of the past.</div><div>And he grew old. He watched the world turn around him, and the sun dim, and that place become another place. And though he searched day upon day, he knew that there would be more to come. And strangely, hopelessly immortal, Amalkreth the wizard of note lost his memory, and did many strange and amazing things. And some hundreds of years later, graduate of a school he had founded, incomplete practitioner of an art he had created, he had a new name, and he was again wandering the desert of Vemate, which is eternal.</div><div>Above the deserts of Vemate, the sun burned as if it were a ball of charge-coupling plasma, building hydrogen into helium and giving off light and heat. That light poured over the wild deserts of Vemate liberally, turning the mica-flecked sand into an enormous bowl of scalding-hot air. For the unprepared to venture across the deserts of Vemate, it was suicide. Even those few who were prepared took with them wagon-trains of water and food, shelter from the vicious sandstorms that ran without season or sense across the dunes. From the sky, a serpentine trail of footprints was visible in the sand, terminating in a walking man.</div><div>“Turn the desert into a giant mirror, and use the reflected light to illuminate the stars. Are you completely daft?”</div><div>His name was Sehdemajeran Menshemeran, and he was a Word-mage of the Second Order. The white cloak about his shoulders was tattered about the hem, and his hands were scarred and callused. The clothes beneath his cloak were dun with wear and sand and sweat, and he was talking to his staff.</div><div>“Well, no, I’m not saying that it couldn’t be done, I’m asking why I would want to do it.”</div><div>His staff, dark with years of oil and sun, did not audibly reply. In the distance, something silver reflected the sun into Menshemeran’s eyes. He grumbled, described an arc before him with the staff.</div><div>“Shade,” he said, and a smoky-gray barrier was between him and the light. Studying it more closely, Menshemeran circled the distant form with his fingertip.</div><div>“Magnify.”</div><div>And the figure, for figure it was, grew larger in his sight. A fine-boned young man or woman, short hair standing up in spiky tufts that wavered when he or she moved. The woman -or-man, swathed in a dark robe, lay insensate on the sand. A heavy steel back plate was responsible for the reflected sunlight. As Menshemeran watched, the figure tried to pull itself upright. It rose on its knees before falling back to the ground, and did not stir again.</div><div>The wizard closed his eyes briefly, banishing the seeing window. Pulling his back straight, he muttered a translocation spell, then knelt by the overwhelmed young person. He laid his hands on her person, and drew them back with a stifled cry. His palms and fingertips were an angry red, scorched by unseen flame. When Menshemeran concentrated, the angry marks faded, healing until he could once more feel his hands.</div><div>Working a charm to ward his body from heat, Menshemeran ran his fingers through the young lady’s hair. That too had been transformed in the river of dreams, into pellucid scarlet strands. The fires of dreamstuff coursed through her; below her body, the sand flowed into glass. Under the searing summer sun, the page burned.</div><div>“Oh, my dear, what have you gotten yourself into?”</div><div>Her lips parted, as if to mouth some silent reply. As her back arched, and the molten glass glowed white hot, she seemed to smile, or to grimace.</div><div>And oh, how she burned.</div><div></div><div>Bel dreamed..</div><div>And in her dream, she could see from one end of the field of bones to the other. She could see the beast, and see it bounded by a shining wall. She watched the creature she had summoned to protect her turn, and watched it advance on the armed and armored people who intruded on her sleeping mind. They shone too, with the brilliance of the gleaming wall. She knew few of them, but there were two who she could easily identity. They stood on the inside of their wall –and it had to be their wall, for who else could it belong to but that pair who fairly radiated power, their hands buried in the barrier.</div><div>Oh, they looked nothing like they looked in the read world, but then, Bel doubted that any of the others looked the way they really did either. But the one with a crown of blackbirds in constant motion radiated power, and it had to be the creature that called itself Willow Gray. That made the identity of the blindingly beautiful woman next to him a matter of course. Kimberly looked little different than she did in the everyday world, saving the green skin, and the glow that seemed to come from somewhere deep inside.</div><div>This was her dreamscape, though. Her home territory. In it, she was queen, all uncertain of her power. From the air around them, Bel plucked the names of the combatants from the air around them, and she knew them as well as her own name Willow and Kimberly and Marilka were strangely shielded, but then she knew them by sight. This Leo, though, and Annie, were new to her. Sarah seemed familiar, and it took only a moment for Bel to recall the woman who had broken fingers on her face. She was lost inside her own mind, and bleeding heavily. Bel could feel the energy she was putting off, and see vaguely into the woman's own mind, her dream. She was a knight, on some noble quest, and as she dreamed, the wall cordoning off Bel's demon grew tighter. And a man, who knelt some distance from the beast.</div><div>He was...it took her some moments to decide what he was doing. He had an instrument in his arms and he was, in fact, singing. And the beast was moving toward him. That much was definite, but the creature seemed muzzy, confused. It's movements were not sure, and where it had moved with unthinking ferocity and speed to dispatch its opponents, now it advanced on this singer –Robin, she intuited—with something like hesitation. There was something in it that did not want to attack, or it was confused by the sounds, so harmonious and at odds with the beast's nature. Leo, whose bright sword and flashing shield had swung true against her summoning, was upon the ground with his arms in disarray and the bones half-restraining him with their rib-cages and the great mass of their weight.</div><div>Annie lay still, and the blood flowed from her nose and mouth. Her weapons lay at her side, broken and useless. There were no more warriors on the field, only one lonely bard with his music and, as Bel pushed her mind toward him, his lonely visions. He wandered inside his own mind and became lost. He aged, he stilled as if to stone, and ages past in his recollection. He rose in the world, and fell. He watched the rise and fall of empires. Lords and kings and the gods themselves listened to his wisdom, and cast him out as a fool. Once he was a cabinetmaker, once a luthier, once a pig herder. And many, many times a magician, a musician.</div><div>And then he was wandering a desert whose name was redolent with echoes of his own power –something he had made in his younger years? Bel found herself wondering. And he saw the brightness of metal, and he went to it, finding a girl, all about with armor and dark clothes. She was dying, trapped in the desert with no shade and no water, and he burned his hands helping her. He caused there to be shade, and he brought down water from on high, and he bathed her brow with rough hands. Bel entered the dream more fully, and began to lose sight of the plain of bones. All she watched was the dream of Robin Redsson, and the woman he tended to, as though it were his only task in all the world.</div><div>And though his face was old, Bel could see in it the visage that was kneeling in bones, in the realm of her own dream. The beard was gray, streaked with red, and his hair was completely gray. But it was every bit as thick as it was on his younger self. Though his hands were old, they moved steadily. Bel focused on the young girl in his care, almost envying her the tenderness that she received. Under the hand of Bel's enemy, surely, but nonetheless the tenderness was complete and without reservation. She was moved by it. Until she saw the face that was the focus of Robin's ministrations. It was her own.</div><div>She screamed and her voice was great and terrible. She shattered Robin's dream completely. When he came back into himself, the chording on his song fell to pieces, and the music ceased to confuse her demon. It shook once, like a dog, and bounded forward.</div><div>The musician fell back aw the demon closed for the last pounce, and Bel lunged moments before her watch-dog ended the confrontation.</div><div>“How dare you!”</div><div>His instrument clutched tight to his chest Robin stared at her. It was a guitar, and battered. Not at all like the shining equipment of his peers. It looked like it could have been pulled out of his real life. He looked like he had been pulled out of real life. No armor, no weapons. Nothing that he had been wearing earlier. Just dark jeans and a leather coat, with a hint of a red shirt underneath.</div><div>Bel shook herself, aware that she was staring, and thus, so was her demon. It was inching forward now, oozing like a puddle toward Robin's legs. She could feed him to the demon any time. So she stopped it, First a mental command, then a ritual one, when her will alone proved insufficient.</div><div>Almost speechless, Robin managed to get his mouth in line with his mind.</div><div>“How dare I what? What was I doing?”</div><div>Her face almost white with fury, Bel stepped close, like a drill instructor. “You think I need to be taken care of!” She grabbed him by the collar and hoisted him upright. Taking hold of his hair with her other hand, she used it like a handle to swivel his head around the battlefield. His friends, wounded –or dead, to his knowledge—on the field. The wall his precious magicians were building to try and keep Bel's demon in, hardly sufficient to keep it from stepping out now.</div><div>“This is my dream. This wasteland is the only place the bird man Willow and all his little playmates—you included, mister guitar—can get at me. This is the guard post, the killing field outside the fortress that you all have to pass.</div><div>“Look around you. Do you see anything? Anything at all? Just your friends, out of commission. Just my personal demon, ready to take you all apart, and get stronger in the doing. Do you think you can make it past that? It was ready to finish you when I stopped it.”</div><div>The darkness was great, and strong, and Bel dared Robin with her eyes to say anything to the contrary. Instead, he nodded. On top of his fear –and there was fear—he felt a great and unstable serenity. He felt like he was surfing on an avalanche, air-boarding into a tornado. All around there was chaos and tumult, and he was a floating island of energetic, capable calmness. He shone inside like diamonds.</div><div>“It was. Thank you for stopping it. Can you help my friends, too?”</div><div>Bel couldn't think of anything to say. So she didn't. Instead, she shook him hard, once. Then,</div><div>“What did you say? Why would I help the people who just tried to kill me? You come here at the bidding of your tribal god or whatever he is, and then, when I've beaten you, when I prove that my strength is greater than yours, you want my help?”</div><div>Robin looked out at his friends, lying on the field of bones. Then her turned his head as far as Bel would let him. She let go of his hair. He didn't fight, and met her eyes.</div><div>“Please?”</div><div>She pushed him away, catching his ankle with her foot and letting him sprawl on the bones of the field. Robin quickly cast his guitar away from himself and the demon. And her ready boots, Bel noted. It made a humming noise when it landed, strings up. Robin's other hand couldn't support all his weight. Or rather, the ground beneath it couldn't. The bones snapped and left his arm was entombed to the elbow. When it sank below the surface, he felt only more bones all along the length of his arm.</div><div>Bel could feel his thought coming out before he said it. She let him say it anyway, not knowing why.</div><div>“Whose bones are these?”</div><div>There was a long moment of silence, and he thought Bel was going to kick him, rather than answer. But eventually she said, shortly, “Mine.” And she started to walk away.</div><div>The demon swarmed up in her wake, moving like some horror movie reject with a smooth, smokey grace that made it seem almost cheesy. It was too good to seem real, but Robin watched it rear up over him, and he knew that he wasn't going to get a reprieve. One hand reached out for his guitar, as if that flimsy musical instrument could save him. He heard Bel from behind the creature, her voice crying something that might have been 'go', or 'no', and the demon, smoke already reaching down to choke him before the claws could rend at him, was pulled back.</div><div>And there was Bel, her arms raised as if in his defense. Robin had a moment of confusion, and he rolled over and pulled at his arm, lodged somewhere deep inside a trap of bone. The beast, her beast, was rearing and bellowing. Inside its voice he could hear the screams of not just his own voice, but others. Male and female he heard, and though it persisted throughout the demons flailing, he could not distinguish more.</div><div>“Why did you do that?” He asked.</div><div>The demon was circling Bel, trying to get around its mistress at the treat she had left for it. She didn't reply</div><div>“Damn your eyes, if you're going to kill me, then do it and be done! Why are you doing this?”</div><div>But she ignored him, and circled with the beast. She shouted at it, cried commands that it did not heed. 'Stop'. 'Kneel'. 'Obey'. It was mad with hate and fury and pain, and the smell of hot iron and smoking blood was stronger. The greasy smoke was thicker. Robin found himself shrinking against the plain of bones while the slip of a woman above him stood against her own construct. Between him and it. He felt a coward.</div><div>And from the wall, which shone and contracted and grew as Bel squared off, there was a shout. It had to have been Willow, his voice reaching down inside Robin to pluck his very soul like some great harp string.</div><div>“Don't let them touch!”</div><div>So he tried again to reach Bel, but it was far too late. The demon ignored her commands entirely now and reached out to sweep her aside. Robin kicked out as hard as he could, and knocked her to the ground.</div><div>The demon pounced. It clawed at its mistress first, and tried to sink its teeth into her shoulder. Robin turned, intercepted the attack, and felt his screaming harmonize with Bel's. He pulled her back with one hand. Wrenching at his pinned arm, he felt something pop in it, as it came loose. Kicking frantically at the beast's mouth, Robin took hold of Bel with both hands and pulled her away.</div><div>Streaming blood, she shook her head and pulled free of his grip. The demon came back to its feet and bellowed, shrieking louder than Robin could tolerate. He fell once more, and saw Bel raise her bloody fists. He watched her attack. And then—</div><div>White.</div><div></div><div>Bel woke.</div><div>And awoken, panting, silent tears running down her face, Bel crawled out of bed to chalk on the floor fresh protective symbols drawn with frantic hands. The bed lay now in the middle of the room, the epicenter of the refreshed chalk mark, and she pulled herself back to the bed to chant inaudibly.</div><div>Bel chanted.</div><div>Bel cried.</div><div>Bel prayed.</div><div>“Don't be real, don't be real, don't be real.”</div><div></div><div></div><div>Black Magic Woman</div><div></div><div>in the fire and the flood</div><div>when all you hear</div><div>is the rush of blood</div><div>you know what's coming</div><div>you know what's here when</div><div>everything you're saying</div><div>is coming out 'fear'</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, Fear</div><div></div><div>Something was moving downstairs. Arms wrapped around herself, Bel knew it. She couldn't feel her demon—and she was prepared to call it a demon now. She had felt its hate directed at her, and then...nothing. Lingering on her tongue was the taste of peppermint, and she didn't know why. And something was moving downstairs. It prowled, she thought. It was pacing the edges of a confinement. Then she started, as she realized how she knew those things. Her demon was out of her mind. But it had a body now. It had to, or in opposing her it would have been torn asunder. It had to have retreated into a physical body, cut off from its dreamers. Her only contact now came from the circle she had cut into the floor around the painting.</div><div>Her tank top was cold, and her scars ached. She tottered to her feet while tugging at her boxers, pulling them back up around her waist. It was a long moment before she broke the edge of the protective circle around her bed, but when she did, she felt the full fury of the caged beast, and she felt it calling on the Pack to free itself. It wanted to feed.</div><div></div><div>Willow pulled everyone in the room out of their dream with an abruptness that left them gasping. Annie started shivering at once, her teeth chattering so hard that it sounded as if they might break. From nowhere, Willow pulled down a blanket and wrapped it around the woman. A moment's concentration from him, and it began to radiate heat. Then he turned to Robin and jerked him to his feet.</div><div>"You are coming with me. Now," and Willow brooked no opposition. His face was hard, and in the depths of his eyes, things moved. "Sarah! Kimberly! Marilka! Come with me right now. We have to get to the painting."</div><div>"Why?" asked Kimberly. "I thought that we were just going to starve it to death."</div><div>"There's no time! Come with me!" and he stormed to the door, which flung itself open. When Isabel and Rose made as if to follow, he threw out an imperious hand. "No. You stay. The beast is free, and Naomi needs to be protected. You stay in my house, and if it gets around us, remember your pendants. And remember where the kitchen knives are."</div><div>He strode out, leaving Marilka, Sarah, and the rest to run after him.</div><div>They caught him before he had crossed the street, and as they closed the distance, his anger was literally palpable. He was radiating heat, and the ravens took to the air as Robin came abreast of him. He was shining somewhere deep inside, giving his skin the look of thin marble, lighted from the far side. He looked as flexible as stonework, and the weight of his gaze was staggering. Kimberly, coming up on the other side of him, felt that should he toss his head, she would see lightning dancing in his hair. The wind, lively as it always was during the spring, was roaring within ten feet of the man. Robin could feel the heat of Willow's anger drying the air, turning those moist spring breezes into the dry wind of summer.</div><div>“Come on,” Robin shouted, “what happened?”</div><div>"We were going to lock the beast away from the minds of the Pack. But Bel stopped the creature from attacking Robin, and when it tried to attack her, something broke. I think it might have been her link with the beast."</div><div>“What does that mean?” Kimberly asked as they cut through as lawn. The picket fence that bounded a yard tore itself apart at Willow's approach. He didn't take notice. Behind him, Marilka gestured, and the fence was made whole again.</div><div>“It means, now we fight,” said Sarah. “Now I get to kill it.” Her eyes shone.</div><div>They crossed another street and were confronted with the mouth of the Pack's alley. Swettt street was still some distance further off, Kimberly knew. But it stood in front of her. The logical part of her mind objected even as they approached the darkness, but she shut it out. There was no place for those thoughts here. Not anymore. The streetlights that should have illuminated the mouth of the alley were gone. Blown out with rocks or magic, Kimberly had no idea. But they were dark, and shadows pooled like oil slicks.</div><div>Willow came  a slow stop next to the telephone pole that supported one of the defunct streetlights, as well as a double dozen electrical wires. His eyes rolled across the scene, a predator looking for an opening, or studying poisoned bait.</div><div>Marilka, watching the shadows as if they were quicksand liable to reach out and snatch her up, murmured as if to herself. “This is the long dark. The dark of dead and dying souls. This place is wrong.”</div><div>Willow nodded shortly at her, acknowledging her words, and stretched out one hand to rest on the telephone pole by which he stood. It immediately caught fire around his hand, flames streaming out blue and orange. He snatched his hand back, stared at the charred black print he had left. Closing his eyes, Willow raised his hands and then slowly lowered them, exhaling forcefully as he did so. This time, when he set his left hand carefully on the charred mark made by his right one, nothing but a wisp of smoke rose from the dry wood. He flexed the hand, and the pillar of wood seemed to ripple. He whispered a word, too low for Sarah to hear him.</div><div>And then there was light.</div><div>From the dark bulbs above, first a low red glow kindled and then a bright, white light burst out. It grew in strength, and then seemed to leap across to the lamppost on the far side of the alley mouth, which burst into shining light in the same fashion. The shadows fled.</div><div>“What the hell did you do that for?” Kimberly asked. “Even I felt the magic that went into that. They're going to know we're coming this way.”</div><div>Marilka laughed loudly then. She had aged in their sleep, and now she was definitely on the far side of thirty five. Perhaps almost forty. Her dress had changed again, both cut and color. More conservative, a little closer to black. “Honey,” she said, “on this night, in this place, they know we're coming. It's only a matter of when, and how.”</div><div>“Besides,” Willow grated. “I stepped to the bell with all this dream business. I might as well ring it, and finish it. Tonight.”</div><div>Robin nodded. “Now.”</div><div>The street was still dark, but as they followed Willow down it, there was less vengeful darkness, tense with the need to strike, and more ordinary darkness, through which Willow and Sarah, Kimberly and Marilka, and even Robin, slipped though as if it were the very essence of stealth. They were soon at the entrance to Bel's home. As Willow stepped to the door, he recoiled as if he's pressed his hand against a live wire. He cursed and tried again, with similar results.</div><div>“What is it?” asked Robin.</div><div>“It's warded.” Surprisingly, the answer came from Sarah. “He just did the metaphysical equivalent to walking face-first into a sliding glass door.”</div><div>Willow as running his fingers over what appeared to be empty air, sliding them forward in some places and rounding out his palms in others, as if there were some invisible protrusion. There was a scream inside, and Robin was moving even before he realized that it had been Bel's voice. He tensed where he should have his the shield, and passed right through before slamming into the door. It was solid, and chained. He kicked at it and when that didn't work, used his gun off the range for the first time in years. The lock took two rounds, and then the chain snapped under his shoulder.</div><div>Behind him, he was dimly aware of a rush of air and the sound of breaking glass, but the tableau before him took all of his awareness.</div><div>The beast was real. And it was here. An overturned easel and canvas—blank—were lying on the floor across what looked like a circle in a variety of metals, chipped and inset into the wooden floor.</div><div>Bel knelt in a doorway opposite him, hands over her mouth as she stared at the creature. Two members of her pack were kneeling next to the beast, attacking the metal circle with what looked like kitchen knives. Jess had two hands on her knife and was trying to pry up and edge. Opposite her, on Robin's left, another woman with white bandages wrapping her arms was using two knives like spear points and stabbing at the circle. Robin blinked once and took two steps to the right, removing Bel from his line of fire. Lifting his gun again, he braced his wrist and fired thirteen shots of forty-five caliber ammunition into the creature, center mass. The creature roared and lunged at him, and Robin flinched out of the way as it was brought up short at the perimeter of the circle.</div><div>He had just enough time to wish he had thought for a second before emptying his gun, and then the white-bandaged woman was on him with a knife in each hand, Jess a half-step behind. Hoping his leather jacket would protect him somewhat, Robin stepped up and smacked the grip of his gun into the madwoman's forehead. She reeled, but swung her blades and managed to connect with at least one, as Robin felt the freezing-hot bite of steel in his side. He kicked out and threw his gun at Jess, but she wasn't there anymore.</div><div>Steel bit him again and he kicked out, throwing Jess back a step, directly into Sarah's flying tackle. There was an odd combination sound that tried to mix a crunch, a clank, and a crack. It tore at the stomach and the flinch response, and Robin dimly heard Sarah speaking to the woman she straddled. “That's the second time I've broken a finger on one of you fucks.” This was followed by more crunching sounds. Something made a whump sound, and the walls behind him buckled inwards–he felt them against his back—and suddenly there was no sound at all.</div><div>Robin stepped into the bandaged woman's next wild thrust, deflecting it with one arm –gods bless his leather coat, no pain—and tripping her up with one well-placed foot. He followed her to the ground and grabbed hold of her hair, banging her head into the floor until she stopped moving.</div><div>There was a moment of silence, and only then did Robin realize that the floor was covered in broken glass, and it was in his hair and stuck in parts of his coat. “What happened?” He tried to say, but there was no sound. In fact, there was more than the usual deafness than usual for having fired an unsilenced forty-five in close quarters with no protection. He wasn't hearing anything. Then Willow swept in, and he understood. He also understood why he hadn't been spitted by Jess and her accomplice working in tandem. “Broken wards?” he tried to say. Again, he didn't know if he succeeded.</div><div>Willow looked sharply at him, then stalked to his side and laid one hand on his head. There was sound again. Wet, hard pack! sounds were coming from the ground at his side, and he looked, shaking his head to clear it somewhat. Sarah had Jess pinned to the ground. The latter had one hand fixed to Sarah's shoulder, the tips of her silver claws were digging in, and blood welled up around their tips.</div><div>A bloody grin covered Jess' face, and one of her canine teeth was broken off. Her right hand was outstretched and, like her left, it ended in silvery points that gleamed with sharpness and blood. Sarah had a hold of Jess' right hand with her own, cross body. Her left hand was clamped on the claw driven into her shoulder, holding it there. Keeping it from finding something more vital than a shoulder. The meat-hammering sounds were from Sarah, slamming her face into her opponent.</div><div>Willow reached out to intervene –perhaps pull Sarah back before she killed someone—but was too late, as she rolled away from him, toward Bel and the circle, jerked Jess' claw from her shoulder, and kicked her in the chest—right into the circle.</div><div>Willow lunged forward. Robin pushed his way to his feel. Marilka's arms were at full extension, magic sparking off her fingertips, and Kimberly simply tried to dive across the room. There was too much space to cover, and no one was fast enough. Blood spattered across the circle, and Jess' claws scored at the floor. Her blood filled up the scratches, and the demon roared its triumph. Jess smiled fiercely, and she died.</div><div>The demon swarmed out of the circle, bellowing the while, and fixed on the closest target to it. Sarah. Still straightening up from her kick, she had time to half-raise her hands before the beast was on her. There was a soft, wet sound, and she went slack, her eyes rounding out. Robin saw strange shapes distorting the back of her coat, and couldn't reconcile what they meant until he saw them as shapes that fingers would make, pressed against the coat alone.</div><div>The demon flexed, and Sarah coughed. It was a wet sound, and when she coughed again there was a floor of bright arterial blood. It poured down her shirt, and the demon lowered its head to feast. Then Willow moved, and time stopped.</div><div>The air crackled around him as he lunged in to the left, sliding in front of Kimberly and pivoting on his right foot. His coat collected around his legs, then flapped out behind as he lunged a second time, to the right. The brought him up against Sarah's left side, and he swung both his fists upward, laced together. The air itself glowed it their passage, and the entire room felt warmed.</div><div>The laced fists struck the creature's head, lifting it almost into the air. Willow twister his body to the left punching with his right hand, and drove it back a step. He turned right, and punched with his left, and the demon did fall, throwing Sarah almost across the room, away from Willow.</div><div>“Marilka! Take her!” His voice was loud enough that it shook dust down from the rafters. Kimberly finished her leap and, deprived of a target, hit the ground. Robin covered his ears in pain.</div><div>“But—“</div><div>“Now!” and this time he took Marilka's arm and threw her across the room, where she bounced off a wall before landing heavily across Sarah's body. It shook spasmodically on the floor, and more blood poured out of it, just like a pitcher of water. The head turned and Willow saw Sarah's eyes in her blood-smeared face. They were still wide, but there was no thought in them. Only dull sensation. She stopped shaking, and flickered. She and Marilka shimmered like a heat-mirage, and then were gone.</div><div>A corona of fire flickered around Willow, now. It did not consume his clothing, but everything he wore flapped in the wind of the fire. Huginn and Muninn took to the air, circling the room near the ceiling. The demon recovered its feet quickly and hunched its shoulders, then charged. But across its neck and head were burn marks were Willow had punched it before. It bellowed as it came, the screech of tearing iron and hate. It stepped in Sarah's blood and sprang at Willow, claws extended.</div><div>But Willow stood his ground and at the last second, spread his arms wide. This time, the soft wet sound rang like doom in Robin's ears. Willow looked down, almost in surprise at the claws embedded in his chest. He tried to breathe, but there was only a choked, burbling sound. Bel screamed, still cowering in the doorway. But then she was up, and moving forward. Her screams were commands, now, and if they had the ring of power, it didn't seem to be affecting the demon.</div><div>Robin stumbled forward, thinking that if he could somehow pull Willow away that he could heal himself. Kimberly's screaming caught him by surprise, and she launched herself at the pair faster than he could think. The demon pulled its claws out, and sank them in again. Its mouth fastened onto Willow's neck and wrenched at it, lifting him off his feet.</div><div>Kimberly reached Willow first, hauling back on his coat, trying to make the demon let go. The creature half-withdrew one gory claw to strike her, but Willow took hold of its wrist and, as it screamed at the touch of fire or his flesh, jammed the talons back into his own flesh. Bel reached the beast and sank her fingers into its hot-metal back, trying to pull it away. But Willow's left hand lanced out and caught hold of her throat. A sanguineous smile graced Willow's face, and inside the deep fury on his face, there was a flicker. The fire roared higher, and Robin might have heard him say something.</div><div>“This is going to hurt.” Bel screamed, Willow screamed, and the beast shrieked in hatred and fury. And they were, all three of them, gone. Kimberly collapsed on the floor. Robin wobbled for a moment, and followed her down.</div><div></div><div>Willow was true to his word. It hurt more anything had ever hurt. It felt almost like being shot, only it hurt everywhere, and she felt herself raveling into nothing. Parts of her fragmented and broke off, and something small and dim inside her knew that there wasn't very much left to break off.</div><div>“Hold onto those, damnit!”</div><div>She was almost gone, and she knew that it would stop hurting then. Bel let those parts of her drift off, feeling the stitching that bound her together body and soul slowly coming undone.</div><div>“You're going to need those later, you fool!”</div><div>The pain only increased, but she let herself continue to fall apart. It would be over soon, she knew, somehow. If only that voice would go away.</div><div>“Bel, if you don't help me, we are both going to die. I've gotten over that once –how do you think you'll do?”</div><div>That got her attention. Die? She didn't think that she would die. She would just be...at peace. Which, now that she came to think about it, did sound a lot like death. But it hurt so much...</div><div>“Hold yourself together, and it will get better. But if you let yourself fall apart, it will never stop.”</div><div>Never?</div><div>“Never. Let me in, I can help you.”</div><div>Let him into her mind? Into her fortress? She couldn't do that. Letting someone else in would give him access to everything she was. And though she was less and less who she was by the moment, something in her still screamed at the thought of someone else behind her shields.</div><div>“Trust me. I do this all the time. If anyone can help you, it's me. And you'll have just as much power over me. That's how these things work.”</div><div>But, but...it hurt too much, she couldn't say no, and she opened herself. He was there, inside her defenses, before she could change her mind. He took nothing, touched nothing but the earth he stood on, but she felt warm power reach out across the frayed and broken parts of herself and re-knit loose laces, pull back parts of herself that had gone begging. There was even a sense that parts of her gone from the very first were on their way back.</div><div>What.</div><div>She tried again. “What is happening?”</div><div>“Try making yourself a body, here. It will be easier for both of us to understand if you do that.”</div><div>She did, and immediately whimpered as the pain assailed her in this new form with redoubled vigor. She was a hairsbreadth from dissolving the body and trying to escape the agony when He appeared. When he showed up, she didn't know how she had ever thought she could attack him. There was so much power in that body. And so much knowledge in those dark eyes that laughed gently at her, and themselves. She tried to speak, but it came out as a whimper. His brow creased with concern, and He was abruptly beside her. Moving slowly, he laid one hand on her shoulder. The pain lessened, and white lines of tension appeared on his face.</div><div>“You carry a lot of pain in you. I'll hold some for a while, Bel. But it has to go back to you before we leave here. It's not mine to carry. I'm sorry.”</div><div>And she thought about what she had done, and felt shame for the hurt she had caused Him and those who were under His protection. He chuckled.</div><div>“Let's drop the capital letter, okay? I've never really been comfortable with that sort of thing.”</div><div>“But, you're, you're...”</div><div>“I'm strong. And I'm experienced. And I've been damn lucky for most of my life. Want to know a secret?” He waited for her nod. “That story you told Kimberly, in my house? In one of my lives, it was true. Not the one I lived, but one of the lives I could have lived. And so I remember it. See,” he said, leaning up against nothingness. “I ended up broken apart like you were headed for when I did this.”</div><div>Bel felt small, and very alone. “Really?”</div><div>“Yes. Of course, it took a little longer for me to get to this point, but I got there all the same. And then it took me thirty years to put myself back together afterward.”</div><div>She looked stricken. “You mean...you mean I can fix this?”</div><div>Willow looked upwards, then down. He settled his weight solidly on two feet, and looked her in the eye. He was very serious now. “No. Not like you're thinking. There isn't any 'undo' button for what's happened. But you can put yourself back together. And for the rest? You can only do your best.”</div><div>“But...how?” She sounded plaintive, and Willow gestured at the great expanse of nothing.</div><div>“How about we go somewhere that's a little easier on the eyes, okay? Maybe you're okay with the sight of unfettered infinity, but it really bugs me.” He gestured, and they were in the Sunshine City laundromat, on Third street and Tarr lane.</div><div>Bel's eyes bugged out. “That's amazing! How did you transport us back to the real world? I feel just the same!”</div><div>Raising one hand, Willow pulled off his coat and draped it over the back of a dinged-up chair that he pulled back from an even-more-abused linoleum table. Under the coat, his clothing was so utterly ordinary that it confused Bel. A sweatshirt over a tee-shirt, loose green pants, and a pair of work boots. There was nothing special about the clothing, but on this man they were like the cloak and mantle of an angel. The radiated power, and he himself fairly radiated a sense of capable control, while maintaining the impression that he was just a polite young man. How could she have not seen the Presence shining through the flesh, wearing the body like she would wear a Halloween mask?</div><div>Bel waited, and Willow lowered his hand after a moment. “No objection? Interesting. This place,” and he waved his hand. “Is a metaphor. We're still in the nowhere that I took us to, but now it's a slightly more...dressed up... nowhere.”</div><div>“This place,” Bel banged a hand on one of the top-load dryers, which clunked loudly, “is just a metaphor?”</div><div>“Yup. Don't think about it too hard, or the whole place might vanish. The results would be...unpleasant.”</div><div>Bel couldn't help it. Despite the pain that wracked her, she chuckled, and then gave a surprisingly girlish giggle.</div><div>“Don't laugh, I'm not joking. It takes a lot of concentration to hold us in a place that the universe is convinced shouldn't exist. We really don't want to get dumped back into the real world with your lovely little hate demon, his fingers wrapped in my guts and his fangs in my throat. Know what I mean?”</div><div>Bel's giggle died in her throat, and she went pale. Her voice was thin, almost lifeless. “I know what you mean.”</div><div>“Do you know what happened to you, when you touched the demon, first in dream and then in life?”</div><div>She shook her head mutely.</div><div>“At least part of it is part of you. But it has its own intelligence. You got that far in my notes, right?”</div><div>“Right.”</div><div>“Okay, so in dream, the creature knew that if it stayed in contact with you it would break up, and parts of it would start to re-integrate with your personality. The mind likes everything that is supposed to be attached, to be attached. So when the parts come together they try to pull back together, much like magnets.</div><div>“But the demon didn't want to reintegrate. You had a degree of control over it, and it is in the nature of the beast to be uncontrolled. So it poured its power into the painting that Leo foolishly made, and became physical. That way, all it had to do was stay away from you, and you couldn't control it.</div><div>“But when you actually touched it –your blood to its, your blood to mine—you linked all three of us together, and you sort of forced a re-integration. But there was a problem.”</div><div>“It's not just me that's in the demon.” Her voice was still reedy. She almost whispered as she stared that the table. She pulled out a chair and sat down.</div><div>“Bingo. You ate your own hate and rage and sorrow and fear –and whatever anyone else put into the stew, too. Your mind couldn't take it, and it started to come apart. My demon did something much the same to me. The good news is this: you can control the demon, and hold yourself together, and become a whole person again.”</div><div>“What's the bad news?” Her eyes came up, holding a hope that would have looked almost pathetic to anyone but Willow. He smiled at her gently, holding her eyes.</div><div>“The bad news is, you have to make the whole demon part of you. You take it all, or nothing. And if you take nothing, it's just going to come back.”</div><div>Bel swallowed. “I have to...All of them?” She asked plaintively.</div><div>“All of them,” and here Willow's voice lost its softness. “You called it up, and now you, personally, have to put it down again. Noli evocare quod reprimere non potes.”</div><div>“Latin,” she said. “It means 'do not call up that which you cannot put down,' doesn't it?”</div><div>“That's the modern translation, yes.”</div><div>“I learned that from Jess. Am I going to know that sort of thing myself, now?”</div><div>Willow hesitated. “Maybe. It depends what they put into the demon. If it's in the creature, then yes, you'll get it. But the knowledge will never be good. They didn't put anything good into that construct. I'm sorry.”</div><div>“I guess it's okay. Will this make it stop hurting?” She asked.</div><div>“Sort of. It won't be physical, anymore. But you're going to have to feel intimately everything that, well...” he trailed off, then brightened. “There's more good news, though. I caught you early, so I'm pretty sure you'll come out as almost the same person you went into this as. Plus all those extra memories, of course.”</div><div>Bel shrugged and squared her shoulders, ignoring a flicker of anxiety and the mental image of a man in red playing guitar. “Let's start now, then.” And she wouldn't think about Robin until it was over.</div><div>The Sunshine City laundromat disappeared, and they were surrounded by nothing. Willow smiled sympathetically at her.</div><div>Then they began.</div><div></div><div>Robin had found out that he still had bones in his legs, and was testing them out when Willow and Bel came back. They both looked haggard, and Willow's shirt was shredded, ugly claw-wounds marring his torso. Along his neck, blood soaked the cloth of his hooded sweatshirt along the line of the demon's jaw. Bel, by comparison, just looked burned up. Her eyes were smudged black, as if she'd broken her nose. Her thinness was exaggerated more, even, than normal. Rather than a whip-saw of scrawny muscle, she looked as if she had starved herself and then taken up marathon running. As soon he Robin properly registered the presence of the two apparitions without the third—the demon—they collapsed.</div><div>Kimberly was on her feet before Willow hit the ground, and Robin was on his knees next to Bel nearly that fast. She was breathing, and still had a pulse. In his lap, she was feather-light, like a bird or a balloon or some other fragile thing. He looked over at Willow, fearing what he would see.</div><div>His wounds were healing. Foaming as if someone had poured hydrogen peroxide over them, the holes in his torso closed, scabbed, and then the scabs flaked away. There remained ten puckered red scars running from just under his nipples on both sides down to the waist of his pants on the left side. The right side had a closer grouping, a circle, five inches in diameter, of furious ridged skin. After a few moments, the scars faded to lividity. Willow leaned back his head and sighed. He coughed then, and turned his head to the side, spitting out a clotted lump of what Robin could only identify as body tissue, and leave it at that.</div><div>Seeing that he was going to live, Kimberly's eyes lit on Bel, and she started to move from Willow's side, a fey light burning in her. Willow's hand fell on her thigh, and he pushed her back down.</div><div>“Don't. She saved us. I wasn't strong enough. Neither was Marilka. Bel had to do something if we were going to live. And she did it. So don't hurt her.” Willow coughed again, and spat out something this time that Robin couldn't classify as either liquid or solid. He averted his eyes. “She's been hurt enough. And there's no threat now. Not to us.” Willow leaned his head back against Kimberly.</div><div>“We're safe,” he said. “We're safe.”</div><div>“What about Sarah?” Asked Kimberly.</div><div>When Willow's eyes opened again, they were haunted, human eyes.</div><div></div><div>I Wish I Had An Angel</div><div></div><div>A poet’s purpose</div><div>In my veins.</div><div>But still I can</div><div>find no remains</div><div>of the sanguine shames</div><div>I left behind</div><div>in swirling drains.</div><div>Elizabeth Belenos, Graffiti</div><div></div><div>Nothing moved on Sweat Street as the sun tumbled into her bed and drew vermeil curtains across the sky. The sagging Victorian house that Bel lived in seemed washed with blood. Bel herself sat on the steps, coat pooling around her. The smile on her face held more pain and bitterness than usual. Those tears that slipped out of her hands landed on her coat, glistening as they were drawn into the wool. She heard boot heels beating time, coming down the street. When she lifted her head, Robin met her eyes and nodded. He stopped in front of her, the light from the evening sun making his pants the red of a smoky fire. His boots and jacket were the ebon-red of blood spilled by starlight. For some time he stood, staring at Bel as she cried without sound. When at last he spoke, Robin’s voice was loud, out of place in the silence of the street.</div><div>“Hi. Willow told me… Anyway, I thought you might want someone you could talk to. Or whatever.” He found a seat next to her, just beside the personal space her pooling coat marked.</div><div>Bel snuffled into her hands. “What do you want?” she ran her fingers, tear slicked, through her blond spikes.</div><div>“I'm not trying to get anything from you, if that’s what you mean.” Robin nodded, “I promise.”</div><div>“Don’t promise.” Bel dragged her hands along her pant legs. “Statistically, making promises to me has proven unhealthy.” She winced. “Of course, Willow made no few promises yesterday, so maybe he meant to change my mind.”</div><div>“Changing minds is what Willow does. It’s a talent.”</div><div>“Some people call it changing minds. I call it manipulating.”</div><div>“The difference is the intent behind it, I think.”</div><div>“If you say so.” Bel twisted her fingers in the folds of her coat. “I don’t think I’m qualified to decide. I mean, look at my record.”</div><div>“I guess. But Willow keeps telling me that ‘past actions are no indication of future behaviors.’”</div><div>Bel shrugged. “Maybe.” She shook her head, and her white-blond hair shook like a field of wheat. “What am I going to do?”</div><div>“It’s your choice. But right now, I kind of want to take a walk. You up for it?”</div><div>Again, Bel shrugged. “Sure. Where are we going?”</div><div>“Beats me. I just like walking. Also, this street creeps me out after dark.”</div><div>She laughed, then. High and loud, it rang across the roof of her sagging house and along the façades that stared out onto Sweat Street. Robin smiled and stood, holding out his hand. “Come on. I think I know where we might go.”</div><div>“Where?” Bel stood up quickly, smile darting briefly across her face when Robin took her hand to pull her along.</div><div>“I’ll tell you when we get there. Come on.” Robin broke into a run without letting go of her hand, not letting up until they cleared Sweat Street entirely. Bel was panting by the time he let go of her hand. When she collapsed against a thick oak, breathing quickly, Robin grinned at her.</div><div>“What, been a while since you’ve had to run anywhere, is it?”</div><div>Bel laughed again. “You could say that. Why the hurry to leave my house?”</div><div>Robin pointed to the sun, fading fast between the swell of hills west of Maplebrook. “Racing the sunset. Get somewhere safe before it gets dark” he winked. “It’s more than a superstition, you know.”</div><div>“The sunset has never held any especial fear for me.” A midnight shiver crept into Bel’s voice. She wrapped her coat around herself, its folds brushing the ground at her feet as she crossed her arms, staring at the shroud that lay over the hills.</div><div>“Not fear, just respect. Come here for a moment, underneath the oak.” Robin beckoned her; slipped an arm around her shoulders as she stepped under the leafy boughs, and drew her back until she was almost leaning against the trunk of the tree.</div><div>“Close your eyes for a moment.”</div><div>“Why?” Bel’s tone was suspicious.</div><div>“Trust me. It’s nothing dangerous.” And reluctantly, Bel closed her eyes, blue veins like a web over her fair lids. Robin slid his hand over her eyes for a moment, then whispered in her ear. “Now look.”</div><div>When Bel opened her eyes, a spectacular scene stared back at her. Above her head, hanging from the branches of the oak, a narrow-chested boy stared at her, grinning. His skin was a vibrant shade of green, the very color of the leaves that decorated the oak. He winked at her and vanished back into the foliage. On the street, which had been deserted moments before, any number of figures walked down the sidewalks or loitered on the street. One of them, only two feet tall and slimmer than a pencil, waved to Robin, who smiled in reply.</div><div>Four pixies flew furiously through the air, each dressed in a gray business suit and talking ferociously into a tiny cellular phone. Their wings made a buzzing sound as they passed.</div><div>A large man with the hindquarters of a goat trundled past, talking earnestly to a nymph who hung on his arm. Bel blinked and wiped her eyes. Everything was still there.</div><div>“Wait, is that satyr…”</div><div>“Oh, yes. They really are like that. He’s trying to sweet talk her. But then, she’s a nymph, so she’s probably already made her decision.”</div><div>Shaking her head in disbelief, Bel tucked her hands into the pockets of her coat. “I can’t believe this is really here. I mean, I always thought it was, but I never expected to see it.”</div><div>“After what you did, you never expected this?” He chuckled quietly.</div><div>Laughing at the contradiction, Bel still elbowed Robin. “Oh, stop it. You sound like him.”</div><div>“There are worse people to sound like than Willow Gray,” Robin raised his brows, “although I’m glad I don’t dress like him. He’s hopelessly dreary in his choice of apparel.”</div><div>Bel blinked, bit her lips, pressed them together into one thin white line, her eyes getting bigger and bigger. Robin looked at her, and raised one eyebrow again. This sent her over the edge; she laughed aloud, began to shake as she laughed clutching her ribs before she staggered into first Robin, then the tree behind her. It was only after she fell to the ground laughing and kicking her feet, giggling like a child, that she noticed someone else under the oak with her.  Immediately she flushed, then narrowed her eyes. Marilka stared back at her, and the scarlet badges on Bel’s cheeks grew immeasurably while the embarrassment began to transmute to anger.</div><div>Marilka watched all this, and offered her hand. “Hi Bel. Welcome to the neighborhood. Like what you see?” She gestured to the fantastical creatures populating the city as far as Bel could see.</div><div>“Yeah. It’s… something else.” She took the hand and pulled herself up. “So you know this place too?”</div><div>“Oh my, yes. I’ve been walking here for quite some time. Longer than Willow has been, at any rate. It’s a great place, if you don’t try to hurt anyone. Hey, Klasandril!” This last was directed to and enormous centaur cantering down the painted line at the center of the road.</div><div>“Nice to see you, Bel, I hope we’ll meet again. I’m supposed to be meeting Klasandril, though so I’ve got to go. Later!”</div><div>She jogged off to catch her friend, and Bel waved laconically, pumping her arm twice. Then she turned to Robin, her eyes downcast. “If she's around, does that mean that Sarah's back? I have to try to apologize to her.”</div><div>Robin stuffed his hands into the pockets of his jacket. “She isn't back. We're halfway to where she is. And I asked Willow. He didn't say anything, but...it didn't look good. I didn't ask again.”</div><div>“Oh.” She shrank into herself. “Is she still...”</div><div>“I think so. I'm most worried what that thing has done to her mind. That was the worst part with Annie, and she was just injured in dreams.”</div><div>“Sometimes that makes the mental damage worse.” Bel spoke with a certain amount of confidence here. “Or, at least, that's what I've been able to figure out from Willow's old notes, and some other texts I found.”</div><div>Robin sounded hopeful now. “So she might get all the way better?”</div><div>But Bel just shrugged. “How strong is she? How good a healer is Marilka? The woman was still trying to savage the construct while it had impaled her. That sounds like someone more than capable of pushing her rebellious mind into order.”</div><div>Robin nodded and closed his eyes. Then he shook his head and straightened up. “Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'm surprised the demon didn't run for cover when it saw her coming.”</div><div>Bel tried to smile, but memories of all that emotion overpowered her. Finally, she said, “we didn't put any common sense into it, I'm afraid.” Then she shut up, and concentrated on not crying.</div><div>Robin laid an arm across her shoulder, not touching her body with his own, just resting his arm gently across the back of her coat. Bel's face squeezed up, and she half turned away, sliding back against him. Bringing his other arm around, he held her gently, trying not to suggest restraint. Support, he thought. Just someone to lean on.</div><div>She pulled herself straight after a moment, and he pretended not to notice the fresh, damp trails down her face.</div><div>“The sun is setting,” she said. “Were we going somewhere?”</div><div>Robin nodded, and drew her after him, “Sokonis Park. It’s just a few blocks this way. Come on, let’s run.”</div><div>“Running again?” Bel rolled her eyes. “Don’t you have any dignity at all?”</div><div>“Of course I do.” Robin folded his arms over her hand. “I keep in the top drawer of my dresser, along with my valor, where it won’t bother me as much.” He stuck out his tongue and grinned, then broke into a run with Bel in tow.</div><div>So they ran, all the way to Sokonis Park, at which point Bel was wheezing. Robin was smiling, not even winded.</div><div>“Ass.” Bel panted.</div><div>Robin laughed. “You like it. Come on, I guess we can walk the rest of the way in. If we really must.”</div><div>It wasn’t really very far to the bench in the clearing where Robin wanted to go, and they arrived momentarily. When Robin took a seat at one end Bel stared suspiciously at the bench, as if it was going to do something precipitous. She carefully took a seat as far as possible from Robin, ending up half-perched on the resin bench. When she settled with her coat folded over her lap, chill breezes playing with its hem, Robin pointed.</div><div>“Do you know that tree?”</div><div>Bel gave him a look. “I’m not on a first-name basis with the woods in the town.”</div><div>Robin only laughed at her cold stare and the words, tinkling with ice. “Perhaps I should have been more specific. I meant, ‘do you know what kind of tree that is,’ or rather, who lives in it?”</div><div>Bel just shook her head, almost invisible in the oncoming darkness.</div><div>“It’s a rookery. Most of the crows and ravens and rooks in this part of the city live in it. There are others around, but this is one of the biggest. They act as if they’re all part of the same family, despite their differences.”</div><div>“Really?” Bel’s voice dripped venom. Robin sighed when he heard it.</div><div>“I think you’ve tried to make a metaphor out of something that wasn't supposed to be one. I really wasn’t going for that, though. I was just being informative. Honestly: if I wanted to hit you over the head with symbolic references, I’d have taken you to an art museum.” Bel’s lips curved up, invisible in the lambent starlight, “or maybe started singing ‘It’s a Small World’ or some other inane ditty about tolerance.”</div><div>“If you want me to be friendly, you should try singing,” Bel searched for an obscure band. Then smiled wickedly. “Nymphomaniac Fantasia, by Nightwish.” No way he would know them. Nobody knew about the crazy Finnish band.</div><div>But Robin nodded and slipped his hands into his jacket pockets. “I’m not sure. You put me in a more Feel For You frame of mind, really. Oh, what’s that, is that a blush?”</div><div>And it was, but Bel wasn’t about to admit it. “I can’t believe you know Nightwish,” She said, instead.</div><div>“I run a nightclub where I was DJ for seven years. Nightwish has been pulling in gold albums and singles since they debuted. If you really want exotic music, you should try listening to the stars’ chants, with fairy bands playing a counterpoint.”</div><div>“Who are the Stars?” She was a little irritated he’d managed to stump her so quickly. But when she looked at him, he was smiling in the scarlet light light.</div><div>“Not a band,” he said quietly.</div><div>“Oh.” Bel looked at her feet, listened to the rustling from the rookery. She swallowed, then cleared her throat. “Thank you, by the way.”</div><div>“For what?” Robin slid a little closer to the center of the bench, faced her as well as she allowed.</div><div>“For this. All of this. I don’t know why you’re being good to me. I guess Willow told you to do it.” She snuffled and dragged her sleeve across her face.</div><div>“Willow didn’t tell me to do anything. This is my idea. I thought you might want someone to talk to. If I was wrong, I can go whenev—“</div><div>“No!” Bel shot to her feet, shout echoing briefly among the trees. Blushing, she sat again. ”I mean, no. Don’t go; I don’t want to be alone. Not out here. Not… Inside.”</div><div>“Inside?”</div><div>“I’m always alone.” Her voice drifted into the air, twining about Robin’s ears like cigarette smoke. “Even when there are people all around. I don’t feel alone now.”</div><div>“I feel like that a lot,” he shrugged then and lifted his elbows, resting them on the back of the bench. “Not right now, though.” He reached out, lightly set a hand on Bel’s coat. “You said you found little to fear in the darkness. Neither do I. But sometimes the darkness scares me all by itself, a little. What about you?”</div><div>Even in the dim starlight, Robin saw her stricken look. Rather than chance her running away, he took hold of her coat and pulled her into his arms. When Bel struggled, he took a grip on her arms and held her out.</div><div>“It hurts, yes?”</div><div>She nodded, distrustful and anguished. “I can’t make it go away, but another person sometimes makes it hurt less.” When she nodded again, Robin drew her back into his arms and held her loosely against him. And after a few minutes, when she drew away again, there were fresh tear-stains on her face. Robin nodded, and wiped her face with a corner of her coat.</div><div>“Are you going to be all right?” he asked quietly.</div><div>Bel shook her head. She felt dull and stupid.</div><div>“It's never 'all right'. That's the point, isn't it? No redemption: just consequences.”</div><div>Robin was silent for a long time. Long enough that Bel started to feel alone again, like she'd pushed a little too far –now, even after all she'd done to him and to everyone else—pushed a little too hard. But when he spoke, it was with a voice that crackled as if on fire, with heat undiminished for being spoken so quietly she had to strain to hear it over the night breeze.</div><div>“I don't think Willow was telling you that you'll have to carry a cross for the rest of your life, and if he was he can go straight to hell and I'll be the first one in line to tell him so. Nobody deserves that kind of load, least of all you. I've been on the inside of that kind of scared and it confuses a lot of things. If he doesn't know that, then fuck 'im.” He tightened his arms briefly to punctuate this, but loosened them abruptly, not wanting to give her the chance to fight.</div><div>Bel squeezed her eyes closed and leaned her head back. It was uncomfortable, but she could feel Robin's shoulder through his coat that way. She shimmied down a little, so it wasn't as much of a stretch.</div><div>“He doesn't think so. He made that much clear to me. But that doesn't mean I can be all happy-go-lucky, either.”</div><div>“I can't really see you as happy-go-lucky.”</div><div>“Neither can I,” said Bel. “Not the point, however. It's just,” she growled and rubbed her eyes, hard. “It's just that I can't atone for what I've done. Even if no one was killed,” and here she faltered. “Even if I never saw anyone killed, it doesn't mean that I haven't got a responsibility, now.”</div><div>“What do you mean?”</div><div>Bel said nothing for a while. Rather than try to force out an answer, she listened to the park around her. The wind blew, playing in the treetops and building a susurrus of needles and twigs rubbing against each other, a rustle of freshly grown leaves, a sighing through the trunks around her and Robin. And as she leaned on Robin, an answer came to her.</div><div>“I have a responsibility now because other people have the ability to do what I did.”</div><div>“And that's your fault, somehow?” Doubt saturated his tone.</div><div>“No. But, it means I'm better at...dealing with it.” Bel ran one hand through her hair. “I know how that sort of thing can feel from the inside, and I can work with—or around—it more easily. You understand me pretty well. And when I first started coming to...to listen to your playing, it was when I heard an echo of myself in your music. It was only for a second, just a flash. But it was enough to interest me.”</div><div>“So you'll be able to avert something like what happened here,” Robin asked, hopeful. “Better than Willow did? Without people...being hurt?”</div><div>She shook her head. “By the time Willow showed up, it was too late to intervene. But if someone had gotten to me earlier? It might have worked. And now I can keep myself safe—not with the construct, but there are other ways—and now I'm less scared than I was before.”</div><div>“Why are you less scared?” Robin was intensely aware of the slight body leaning against him, bony even through both coats. The sun had faded, and now he watched the outline of her jaw by starlight. Were they unusually bright tonight, or were they still on the edges of Fairie? He didn't know. He watched Bel's lips as they hesitated over an answer, even tried out a few silently.</div><div>Then: “It's a lot of things. Some of it is, the worst happened and I'm still here. That might be one of the biggest parts of it. Another part is that I have power now. And no matter how I developed it, I can use it for good things, and I can keep myself safe with it. I don't have to hurt people to do it. And there's a part I don't want to say.”</div><div>“Because I'm a different person than I was three days ago.”</div><div>“In that you no longer have the mental equivalent of a rabid dog running around loose,” Robin said, “I'm grateful.”</div><div>Bel tried to laugh, but choked on it. She couldn't laugh at it yet. Maybe not ever, she thought. “So am I. But that's not what I meant. When I disappeared with Willow...we couldn't contain it. Nobody could. No matter what locks we put on it, the construct would have gotten around or through them eventually. And we couldn't kill it, because we couldn't be completely sure it was really dead.”</div><div>“But,” Robin asked, suddenly cold with dread. “What else could you have done?”</div><div>“I had to do what he did.”</div><div>“You died?” Now there was disbelief in his voice.</div><div>“No! Well, sort of, yes. Maybe.” Bel rubbed her face tiredly. “I had to take the demon and make it part of me again. Willow explained how we made it?”</div><div>“In general terms, yes. You took the parts of yourself that you didn't like or hated, or whatever, and put them into this construct that turned into the demon.”</div><div>“Right. The idea was to use it like a shield. We would have control over it, because it was just part of us, but we wouldn't actually have to have those feelings and memories inside us.”</div><div>“But put together like that, it got stronger than all of you, and it started running the show.”</div><div>“No,” Bel shook her head. “It got stronger than any one of us. Willow says that eventually it would have been more powerful than all of us, but it hadn't yet. The trouble was that it could control some of the others by the end. So we couldn't act in concert against it. We couldn't control it. Which leads to what I had to do.”</div><div>“What happened?”</div><div>There was a long silence before Bel spoke. When she did, she was carefully toneless. “I had to make it part of me again.”</div><div>“So...you took the parts you had removed, and tied them back into yourself?”</div><div>Bel sighed. “It doesn't work like that. The, the self, I guess. It's never meant to break like that. And by the time Willow and I got to the creature, it already had a self—it was an entity all on its own,” she elucidated.</div><div>“What does that mean?”</div><div>“It means that I had to take it all.”</div><div>Robin started to push himself upright, remembering only halfway through the maneuver that he was holding someone, they both ended up in the dirt. Bel rolled away and came to her feet, leaving Robin to flail his way upright.</div><div>“That motherless bastard made you mix yourself with a demon?” He balled his fists at his side. “I'm going to shoot him.”</div><div>“No,” Bel stated. There was temper in her voice, and a hint of the power she held. Still furious, Robin suddenly remembered that this striking woman had attracted a small army of followers in only a few months, and held them by charisma and force of will. That was her voice, now. She wasn't asking, or ordering. She was informing him of the way the universe was going to be. And he didn't want to make her angry for reasons of his own. So he tried to let go of some of his fury. Finally, he asked.</div><div>“Why did you do it?”</div><div>“I had to. I don't mean that it was that or Willow killed everyone –he told me,” she said when Robin's eyes rounded out. “I mean that I couldn't have only taken back my part of it. It was everything, or nothing at all.”</div><div>“But...couldn't the others have shared it with you, the way that they had given parts up, just taken them back?”</div><div>“No, they,” Bel sighed hard and ran her fingers through her hair, scratching at the spikes. “Take two crucibles of molten steel, okay?”</div><div>“Okay.”</div><div>“Now pour them into one bowl.”</div><div>“Alright.”</div><div>“After the steel has cooled, separate the two starting steels. You can't do it. It's all one piece. The construct was the same way. And unlike steel, it couldn't just be cut up.”</div><div>“So you took it,” Robin sounded sick.</div><div>“Yes.” Every blow, every cut. Every rape and broken bone. “I didn't have to do it all at once, but after I started, I had to finish it.”</div><div>“But you were only gone for a few minutes. I didn't think there were any parts of Fairie where time ran that fast relative to normal world time.”</div><div>“Bel shook her head. “We weren't in Fairie. Willow just said we were nowhere. He didn't explain beyond that.”</div><div>“So...how long were you in there, from your point of view?”</div><div>Bel looked down, now. “Are you sure you want to know?”</div><div>“It was a long time, wasn't it?”</div><div>She nodded.</div><div>“How long?”</div><div>Looking at the ground, Bel whispered. “I had to live it all again. What everybody put into it. Some people put almost their whole lives inside the creature.”</div><div>“How long?”</div><div>“There were dozens of people involved in the rituals. Most of them were in their twenties. Some were much older. Some were much younger. Those were hardest.”</div><div>“Bel. Tell me. How long were you gone?”</div><div>“A hundred years.”</div><div>And now Robin had nothing to say, suddenly. He felt dizzy, and the scene before him acquired a spin. She was a hundred years older than she looked. A hundred years. Can I deal with a hundred-year age gap, he wasn't sure.</div><div>He spoke into the gently rotating vision he had of Bel, who stood, uncertain but not shrinking back from him. “I...I suppose you're too old for a man my age, then.”</div><div>He was trying to make it sound like a joke, but he wasn't sure if he'd succeeded. There was the strangest ringing sound in his ears. He didn't fight when Bel closed the distance between them and lead him back to the bench, pushing him gently in the chest to make him sit.</div><div>“Robin, it wasn't like an actual hundred years of life. It was a hundred years of beatings, stabbings, fear, and hate. Willow helped a lot. There were times when I could only take one memory, or part of one, in a week. In a month. Sometimes I could take a whole lifetime in an afternoon. But none of the contributors were older than forty, and he didn't give me more than a few memories. They hardly compare to some of what I went through.”</div><div>“But you kept,” Robin swallowed, very aware of Bel sitting close to him. “You kept going?”</div><div>“The alternative being madness and death,” Bel said wryly, “I thought it was the best choice.”</div><div>“I mean, you never thought you'd rather...” he trailed off.</div><div>“Rather die than continue? For about a hundred years, off an on. But Willow wouldn't let me hurt myself, and we waited, and worked it through, and I continued. And I made it. I was strong enough.”</div><div>“Wait a second.” Something had occurred to Robin, jumping his mind from behind a proverbial boulder. “If you were only gone for a few minutes, and you spent a hundred years wherever Willow took you...”</div><div>“Yes?”</div><div>“Willow told us about when that happened to him. He was gone from the real world for thirty years.”</div><div>“Thirty—?” Bel's hands shook a little bit, and faltered as she went to clasp them together. Robin took them in his own hands, dizziness subsiding.</div><div>“Thirty years, when you were gone for maybe three minutes. Oh, God. What must that have been like?”</div><div>“I don't know. I don't want to know.”</div><div>They were silent for a time, stretching out longer and longer as they slid closer together. Eventually, Bel's head leaned against Robin's chest while his arms encircled her. She closed her eyes and sighed, very slowly.</div><div>“What is it?”</div><div>“I haven't told you everything about the third thing.”</div><div>“What?”</div><div>“The reasons I'm less scared? The first thing, the worst, was making myself part of the demon. Or the other way around. I really hope there's no hell, because if there is, that's what it will be like. The third thing is something different. But I need to tell you.”</div><div>Instinct raised the hairs on the back of Robin's neck, and he nodded, wary. “Okay. What is it, that you have to tell me?”</div><div>“I'm...I can't...” Bel muttered a curse and shifted, but when he went to lean away, took hold of his arms to keep them in place. “I saw a lot of shit –lived through it, really—and I guess you can imagine some of it. And it changed me. I took all of the beast into me, too, and that changed me. I literally am not the same person I was. And I, not being the same person, feel differently about a lot of things. Some things I feel more intensely. For example...”</div><div>“For example?”</div><div>Bel took a deep breath and opened her mouth to speak. Then she shut it. Her body was so tense that she quivered. Robin felt like she might break if she strained herself and more, and tried to calm her down, sliding his palms along her upper arms. Nothing aggressive, he told himself. Just to get her to relax. But it didn't seem to be working, and he felt an answering tightness begin somewhere inside him. He didn't think he was going to like what she said.</div><div>“I love you.”</div><div>The tightness inside turned to mush, and the ground dropped out from underneath him. He wasn't sure if he should smile or scream. Wait, she might not mean it the way I heard it.</div><div>“You...don't mean like a relative. Do you?”</div><div>Bel was shaking a little more, now, wound up like a spring. “No. Nothing like a relative. I...” She looked up and lifted one hand to the side of his face, leaning forward. Robin leaned forward a little, and her face was only a few inches away.</div><div>“I...” Bel got out, and the sentence shriveled off. Robin leaned a little further, and her quivering was shaking, now. Confused, he opened his mouth to ask a question, but she stopped him by pushing on his chest, sliding away along the bench. “I have to show you something first. And tell you. Can you take us, or move us, or whatever, to Fairie, again?”</div><div>Robin nodded. “Why do you have to show me?”</div><div>“Because it might change what you say.”</div><div>“I...I want to say that it won't. But I don't know what it is. I can bring us through.”</div><div>“Then do it, please.”</div><div>Reaching out, Robin laid one hand on a tree and closed his eyes. The other hand he left touching Bel. And they were there. She could feel it in the air, though nothing looked different, save the starlight was brighter, the woods darker. But it would show, here. Bel knew it in her bones. She stood up and stepped away from the cast-resin bench, to the center of the path where generations of evergreen needles had the forest floor springy and clean-smelling.</div><div>Her coat brushed the ground as she moved. It was large, even by the standards of such coats. On her, it was enormous. When she pulled it back, it slid easily over her shoulders to puddle at her feet. Beneath, she wore long, loose black pants, and a cotton tank top, also black. Under that, there was either a very thin bra, or none at all. But that didn't hold his attention. Her body was as thin as it had felt. She was hungry-thin. Not starving, but she didn't eat as much as she might like. But that wasn't what commanded Robin's attention. What pulled his eyes and fascinated his mind was the tattoo that adorned the woman in black.</div><div>It started on her left wrist and spiraled up her arm, covering the left shoulder completely. It was a tail, and near the shoulder, talons were visible. It looked to continue across her back, and one wing dipped out of sight down the right front side of her tank top. Along the right side, at  the base of the neck across the trapezius muscle, was a crested, beaked head pointing toward her heart. The colors glowed under the inhuman light of the Other World. Slick and saturated, it looked less like a tattoo than a painting in  ink, layered over top of the skin. The bird looked ready to take to the air.</div><div>“It's beautiful,” Robin breathed, as if any disturbance might drive bird or woman into sudden flight.</div><div>Bel looked on the verge of tears. “Thank you.”</div><div>“Not a raven?” Robin asked, for something to say, something to make her stay.</div><div>“Willow said that I'm not a raven. This is me.”</div><div>Robin took a long, slow step closer. It left him just outside of arm's reach. “Who are you, Bel?”</div><div>She took a shaking breath, holding his eyes.</div><div>“I'm a phoenix,” she said.</div><div>“Is...this what you had to tell me?”</div><div>Bel nodded convulsively. “Yes.”</div><div>“This is everything?”</div><div>“Yes.”</div><div>“Then my answer doesn't change, Bel,” Robyn said, holding out his hand.</div><div>For a moment, she stared at it uncomprehending. Faster than he could track the motion, though, her hand was in his. She squeezed, afraid he might pull back. So he shifted his hand a little and pulled her to him. Her lips met his, and then her arms were around his neck. Hungry-thin, he'd thought earlier. She weight the next thing to nothing in his arms, but she was so strong. Rather than fall, he lowered them to the sweet smelling pine needles carpeting the forest floor.</div><div>And then, for a while, under the lambent starlight of Fairie there were no words, and no fear, and no loneliness. There was just the Phoenix and her musician, and the vanishing space between them.</div><div></div><div>Outside a small, private airstrip at dawn, there was a gray mist that matched the clouds overhead. Also outside the chain link fence was a car, parked in the fallow field beyond the airport. The yellow stalks of dead grass rose up around the wheels of the vehicle in a wheat-like profusion, a layer of green shading the base as the spring growth made itself known.</div><div>Reclining on the hood of the car were two figures. One, slight and starkly blond with invisible eyebrows on an elf-like face, was Bel. By his red pants and leather jacket, the man with her was easy to identify as Robin Redsson. The two of them lay on the hood of Bel’s car, an ancient Ford Falcon whose black matte paint had chipped in many places to reveal white primer and a dull steel body.</div><div>Above them, the dove-colored light slipped along the edges of the trees that lined the field, knots and burls turning into eyes and faces. Birdsong scored the morning with an orchestra of competing, interweaving calls. Bel’s hand slid along the dew-covered hood, touching Robin’s. Still staring up at the sky, Robin's hand closed on hers and pulled her across the hood over her car. Her coat lay beneath them. The nights were still chilly this early in the year.</div><div>Under normal light, the tattoo looked like a tattoo. Breathtaking, yes. Finely detailed and stunning in execution, yes. It was not the thing of life and magic that it had been for the night. But lying beside Bel, he could feel the power rolling through it, and knew that it was the normalcy, not the magic, that was the lie. He smiled at the sky, and turned to the young woman beside him.</div><div>“Good morning,” he said.</div><div>She smiled back at him in the gray-gold light. “It's not morning yet. The sun isn't up.”</div><div> Robin laughed and squeezed her hand. “Point conceded.” Then he frowned. The air had gone still. No birdsong. The crickets weren't chirping. He sat up and looked about. No planes were moving, there was no human noise to hide the sudden silence. Bel took notice also and sat up. Her tattoo flashed slick and bright, then faded back to its plain colors.</div><div>“I don't know—“</div><div>And every blackbird in the city rose, cawing and shrieking in celebration. From someplace that was not the real world, a raven alighted on Robin's shoulder, it's beak near to his ear. Though it was silent, sudden understanding, and joy, spread across Robin's face. The raven leapt to the air and, circling three times, was gone.</div><div>“What is it?” Bel had to shout to be heard over the commotion.</div><div>Robin laughed and kissed her. “It's Sarah! She's back, and she's better!”</div><div>And through the clouds of dark birds flapping through the air, Bel saw the edge of the sun's disk glimmer through the trees. She kissed Robin again and pointed.</div><div>“Now, it's a good morning!”</div><div>The Last Chapter</div><div>Or,</div><div>Into the Sunset</div><div></div><div></div><div>“Fetch me Brian, the Piggy Wrangler!”</div><div>-Willow, regarding an outbreak of swine.</div><div></div><div>In the darkness of Sarah’s apartment, with strange tapestries brought back from far beyond the Lands We Know, the man who had been a fairy prince, been a bird, been a man once more sat calmly sipping tea from an antique cup. The ravens Huginn –thought—and Muninn—memory—were perched on his shoulders. After her stay in the Fairy Queen Marilka’s court, Sarah had furnished her home in a manner altogether in the style of the Other World. At once delicate and capacious, the chair in which Willow sat hailed from no earthly store.</div><div>Conversely, Sarah had kept her favorite ratty red couch, and she sat cross-legged on the arm nearest her guest. Her pants were of a strange weave, with gradations of black and more pockets than such a form fitting garment should have, by rights, been able to hold. Her black cotton tank top was a size too small, faded, and smelled faintly of soap.</div><div>Willow, after sipping at his tea again, cocked one leg up over the arm of his fae-built chair and leaned back, resting his head against the tatty green jacket he’d draped over its wing. This clearly vexed both Huginn and Muninn, who seemed more used to an upright roost, and were seriously contemplating moving their position to his head. Willow tilted his head and smiled at Sarah, after some minutes of silence.</div><div>“Can it be that three years in the Courts of Fairie have actually taught you patience?” He asked. “If I’d known that, I would have sent you years ago!”</div><div>“They didn’t teach me so much patience that I can deal with your meandering, Birdman.”</div><div>Willow laughed and the ravens sitting on him bobbed. When he righted himself, he asked the question that Sarah had been waiting for.</div><div>“Did you like it, Spooky Girl?” Though his voice was warm, Willow did his best to keep it neutral.</div><div>Once more, quiet took the room, and the only noise was of the birds rustling their feathers and dust motes dancing in the sunlight. Sarah drummed her silver-ringed fingers on a knee, then stopped. Then, just once, she nodded.</div><div>“Oh, yes,” a smile curved her lips, slow and sensual. “Yes, I did like it.”</div><div>Sitting up abruptly, Willow threw off his reserved mask and beamed at her, briefly, before settling into his usual equanimity. “I’m glad. Will you be joining me then, when I have business to tend to?”</div><div>“You mean like completely turning this town on its head? Like teaching Bel how to use magic for good things? Like provoking people into being better than they are?”</div><div>“Like that.”</div><div>“Always, Birdman. Always.”</div><div>As another slow smile spread across Willow’s face and ignited a similar expression in Sarah, a red bird born of blood and will alighted on Willow’s arm, settling out of the air from another world. It leaned close and whispered secrets in his ear, and leapt abruptly into flight. Circling the room three times, it uttered a cry, and was gone.</div><div>Sarah raised an eloquent black eyebrow. Willow stood and pulled on his coat, pausing while the ravens righted themselves on his shoulders. Rising and laying aside her mug of tea, Sarah stepped close to Willow.</div><div>“Now?” She asked.</div><div>“Now.”</div><div>Willow raised his left arm and settled it about Sarah’s shoulders. She reciprocated with her right, and they faced into the West. Into the sun, stepping into –through—out of—her window. The walls went away. The world fell away like a satin curtain, and Willow smiled again.</div><div>“Come on, Spooky Girl. Let’s go save the world.”</div><div></div><div></div><div>The End.</div>
